My cell phone might be in my car and it's usually not even charged. I wanted this camera to carry in purse to whip out at any time to get pictures of my grandchildren just like I used to with my children 25 years ago, except this camera is far superior to my old one. It is easy to handle, comes with easy directions, and produces sharp, crystal clear images. Great buy for the money!\", \"I got the new Kodak AZ401BK today, put batteries and an SD card in it and started experimenting to see how well I liked it. For the money, I'd say its a pretty nice camera. The battery/SD card door is a little flimsy, just as another review stated. But the flash, the zoom and the screen quality are superb. The auto focus works well too. The controls are intuitive and nicely sized. The camera is a good size and weight. The grip and neck strap are comfortable. I got this camera, mostly, for improved still images. It does a good job of that. It does not do great video. Its OK, but not great. To put it plainly: It misses 5 stars for two reasons: 1) flimsy battery door and 2) poor video quality. If you aren't relying on this camera to shoot video then I'd say: Get it!\", 'Easy workability. Set it, point and shoot! Pictures are clear and easy to print.', \"I have had many cameras in my lifetime, really expensive and really cheap. I have NEVER had a camera use battery power like this one. I bought rechargeable batteries and a charger and then bought even additional batteries. If you are using it on a day trip, you had better have the backup batteries with you because this camera won't last. Also, the compartment where you insert the batteries has a slide switch where you lock it so the batteries will stay in. If you handle the camera at all, take it in and out of a bag or even wear it around the neck and hold it, it is very easy to move the slide and the batteries will all fall out. It is very light and the pictures will be blurred if you don't really concentrate and hold it tight. I want something I can swing up in a heartbeat and take a snapshot. This camera will not do it. It does take some good pictures but I can honestly say I can't tell the difference between my phone and the camera. I would say you get what you pay for but I have a small Canon that was half the cost and the pictures are just as good if not better. I only bought this one because I couldn't find my Canon. Thank goodness it showed up.\", 'Le cuesta demasiado o directamente no enfoca a objetos de cerca o de lejos cuando haces zoom ni con trípode se soluciona el problema, tengan en cuenta esto antes de comprar tiene problemas de enfoque bastante graves llevo ya poco de menos de un mes usándola y siendo sincero no la recomendaría, cabe admitir que a veces si se logra fotos muy decentes pero el problema del enfoque es bastante notorio en ciertos campos....', \"This is the third Kodak I've purchased in the last 10 years. The first two were Kodak Share's and were great, but no longer produced. When I say the third camera a person has to realize that I use my camera heavy duty 7 months out of the year. I'm a field appraiser and do real estate tax appraisals for three different counties every year. As I'm doing my work I take pictures of any new structures or anything that would affect value of properties. Often that can mean as many as 50 per day. They took lots of wear & tear but held up really well. The first I dropped on a concrete walk. Needless to say, not the fault of the camera. The last one developed a problem in the spring lever that holds the batteries causing it not to stay closed well. I've spent the last three weeks with packing tape holding it shut! 🤣 Then I decided to try the new PixPro, which I ordered through Amazon with very quick service from the dealer. It's so closely made to my others that I don't think it will take any time to master! And even better magnification! 40x where my others were only 20x. I use this feature a lot as many properties are inaccessible with a normal range. My only problem that is preventing using it right away is the camera to computer downloading. With my previous cameras I could download my pictures with the days pictures dated and numbered 1 through the end. I could delete those pictures then start over the next day with 1 . I've not figured out how to master this and am planning on calling the company for help. Right now, if I delete 12 and delete, the next day will be 13, etc. I know there are lots of $$$cameras out there but for my use, Kodak can't be beat! I'll follow up with my service form the dealer if my concerned can be addressed. Read more\", 'I love this product! Very easy to learn, the images are crystal clear, it’s not too big, so it’s light and easy to take around. Plus I love how slick it looks.', 'La cámara es increíble, la resolución que tiene es muy buena, ciertamente mejora mucho cuando las tomas se hacen con el zoom óptico, los modos de fotografía son muy buenos, el vídeo es sumamente estable y agradable, ninguna de estas fotos tiene edición, sin duda es la mejor opción que pueden tener a la hora de comprar una cámara, puede que al principio no parezca que dará buenos resultados, pero conforme más la usas más te das cuenta de lo buena que es, por su precio estoy asombrado por la excelente calidad que tiene Si debo dar puntos negativos está el tema de la batería, ocupa demasiada y utiliza pilas, las que incorpora no son las mejores, así que vale la pena invertir en unas recargables de almenos 2500mah para que tenga buena duración, pero con el ahorro que tienes al comprarla es más que nada una inversión También las fotografías en la noche no son las mejores, pero no se puede pedir más de lo que ofrece esta cámara, sin duda una gran opción Recomendación. Si compras esta cámara por fuerza necesitarás: Una memoria SD de almenos 32gb Un trípode, uno sencillo basta Un estuche para transportarla con más facilidad, aunque no es algo obligatorio Baterias recargables 2500mah, gasta mucha batería, así aguantará para sesiones largas.

It's easy to use and is reasonably priced and gives great pictures. It comes with a strap, lens, 4 AA starter batteries (which are still good ever 3 weeks of use). I did have to buy a USB cable at Staples for $11.00. I do have two extra sets of AA batteries and charger which is recommended. Over all its a great camera for my backyard photography.\", \"This is a great camera for its price. Fantastic zoom: 40x optical PLUS 4x digital, giving 160x Zoom application. Has a 'green LED ' and audible signal when object is in Focus. Which is useful. Definitely needs as tripod when using super zoom, for steady photos. Some reviews complained about poor battery performance but 2 months on I am still using the original batteries that I fitted. Over 130 photos taken, so far. It has all the usual Digital Camera facilities including Video/ Auto/ Program and other Aperture & Shutter Speed applications.\", 'Die Kamera ist von der Leistung für mich als Hobbyfotograf völlig ausreichend. Sie ist genau wie beschrieben und Preis-Leistung ist für mich unschlagbar gewesen.

'Reviews': [\"Bought this camera for a simple camera to use while traveling when I didn't want to take my huge Panasonic camera but still wanted a camera that wasn't on my phone, for safety purposes and also the anxiety of possibly losing or dropping my phone (either off high places, overboard, etc.). Many people say that it isn't worth it, and with the development of quality in phone cameras, why even bother buying a digital one that provides less quality photos than that of your phone, that almost everyone has and carries with them at all times? I personally like having a compact, portable camera that is less of an investment than an expensive smart phone in the case it gets stolen, dropped, damaged, etc. This in itself is an appeal for me to purchase a digital camera to use instead of my iPhone. It was a great alternative to my phone, allowing me to keep my phone tucked away in a pocket or a bag, while still being able to take photographs while on my trips. I really liked the red color offered, as I try to buy everything red. The camera itself is compact and portable, it was super easy to conceal and travel with, adding little weight to my travel bags. The camera is very easy to use, allowing different shooting settings, zoom, and even video recordings. The battery lasts quite a while too, but I bought secondary batteries just in case. I also really appreciate the fact the camera utilizes a rechargeable battery, so you can charge it on trips when you have a break and you don't have to be constantly carrying a set of AAs. The picture quality itself is high, in my personal opinion, really good for the price that you're paying and the compactness of the camera. The video quality could be better, but is decent for the size and price of the camera. If you're zooming in a lot, the video quality is obviously compensated, and the audio quality in videos isn't the best, but. You get what you pay for, and in this case, you actually get better. It's well worth the money, providing video-recording abilities and high quality photographs. I highly recommend this camera for anybody looking for a camera for the same purposes as I. It's well worth the money and has exceeded my expectations in performance. It would also be a great starter camera for someone looking for a simple point-and-shoot camera, or for adolescents looking to get into the camera/photography community. Obviously if you're a professional photographer, I wouldn't recommend this camera, but I doubt anybody professional is looking to take high-quality, professional photographs with a simple point-and-shoot camera. For the price, quality, and performance, this camera is well worth the money, and I highly recommend it!(: Read more\", 'I purchased the Kodak pixPro FZ55 for several reasons: a) I needed a smaller camera that took up less space in my luggage and/or travel backpack; b) used Li-ion rechargeable batteries that could be charged either in the camera or in a small charger; c) took good photos, day or night, of people, buildings, and scenery; d) took good video using 32 or 64 GB SD cards; and e) cost less than $150.00 (for a point and shoot camera!). I received my camera in three working days, opened the box, read the instruction manual, charged the battery (comes partially charged), and put the camera through its paces for a week.  Likes and Dislikes: Look at the comparison photo of my \"normal-sized\" DSLR with carrying strap and regular lens, and the Kodak next to it. Camera fits in my hand. When I travel internationally, usually eight to ten days, I do not use checked luggage; I use only a backpack carry-on that actually fits in the overhead without being offensive to fellow passengers. To do that, the choice in cameras is obvious. Why not just use my cell phone? Because of the increasing number of folks who have lost \\'em, dropped \\'em, or had \\'em stolen. Camera setup using on-screen prompts easy to understand and follow, menu choices easy to ascertain and follow too. Camera takes good photos outdoors as seen in several of the other photos. Zoom (telephoto) capability is average, as seen by the two photos with the white building and vehicles in the distance. Camera doesn\\'t compensate well when too much light is coming in as seen in one photo with bright vegetation and tree shadows, but that can be adjusted with better technique and composition. Macro photos tend to be \"flat\", as seen in one photo, but I expected that without f-stop adjustments or using a tripod. Again, use of better technique would probably help. Also need to think about space and weight in the travel bag.  Zoom is smooth with normal low buzzing sound found in higher-priced point and shoot cameras. LCD screen is small, but I expected that because of the overall smallness of the camera. For me, I can still see the screen image fine. Indoor photos with flash are passable, but one must be close to subject due to reduced flash output. Flash turns \"on\" and \"off\" easily. Timer works well, 2s &10s delay with audible beep when ready to shoot. Use caution and a careful touch when opening the camera to insert or retrieve SD card and/or battery located in same slot, and check that camera is OFF when trying to access the port, located on the bottom corner. Read more', 'I have to say that overall this little camera is good. There is a definite lag between pressing the button to take a photo and hearing the click which means it has happened. Be sure you allow yourself a little extra time before moving the camera. The photos are pretty good/sharp/clear. I have not printed any. I would have preferred a written book of instructions as opposed to a downloaded version. I\\'m not sure that this camera is any better than the cheaper \"kid\" cameras. I went with it because of the brand name. It is good for nonprofessional results, a starter camera, or to use until you decide if you want a better camera or a phone with an amazing camera built in. I have used it to take oddball photos of things that most people would not notice and it has worked ok for those. Again, the lag in pressing the button and taking the picture is a bit annoying. Make sure when you order any accessories that they are for this model.', 'Great simple point and click camera. Pictures is of good quality. It is obviously not a professional camera but it great for someone who has trouble working complicated controls.', \"I purchased this to replace an old Sony Cybershot, and I had to return it. It is cute, lightweight, and super easy to use right out of the box, but the picture quality is horrible. I took the same picture with my old Sony Cybershot and this camera, and the picture from this camera was somehow both pixelated and fuzzy. The zoom feature does not seem to work properly and produce clear photos. Even though I'm not a professional photographer, I want pictures of family vacations to look halfway decent and this does not do that. I think that I got better pictures with an iPhone 6.  Overall, if you want decent photos, don't buy this - the picture quality is atrocious.\", 'Estilo retro. Muy padre. Recomendable y excelente precio por tan buen producto', 'Com dois usos o zoom da câmera travou e ela só desliga se tirar a bateria. Além disso, ao coloca-la para carregar aparece que a ligação falhou e a bateria permanece baixa após horas carregando', 'Fairly easy to use.Instructions could have been a little more detailed.', 'Easy to use, convenient charger', 'Camera worked well with no issues.

For example, a film roll with 36 exposures can yield around 72 half-frame photos - doubled!', '📷 Lightweight and Easy-to-use: The pocket-size camera is light and tiny, and hence convenient for you to bring along daily.

It’s not a professional film camera, so it’s frame is PERFECT for daily use. I keep mine in my tote bag and it’s handled getting tossed around every day and dropped a few times just fine. Very beginner friendly and a great way to get more pictures for your buck!', 'I purchased this camera because I’m going on a trip and wanted to take some pictures that had a vintage feel to them. I’m not a photographer, but I knew with the right roll of film I could get the look I was wanting. Anyhow, I checked out the reviews for this camera and the film suggestions, some reviews included pictures of their developed photos and they looked great. I confidently made my purchase! I feel like you can’t go wrong on the camera itself, just do your research on the film. The camera is plastic essentially, so it’s light weight, that doesn’t bother me very much though. It does have a flash and installing the film was super easy. Also make sure you know of a place that developes film!  Overall the quality is little less than desired, but still a great purchase for me! It’s way cheaper than investing in a fancy schmancy camera and lens when photography isn’t even a hobby of mine lol. This would make a great gift for someone whose interested in photography, or you’re wanting cute photos.', 'I do really enjoy this lightweight camera for outside photography and little memories captured on film. After opening my package I had put in a fresh battery and within two months of having it, I noticed the flash wasn’t turning on. I had only used it up to 50 shots. I changed out the battery and it started to work so I guess I’ll be going through my batteries more often than expected. Other than that the camera has held up and it super lightweight and would be a cute gift for someone starting out with photography or just a cute little camera to have for fun!', \"I'm still relatively new to film photography but, I can confidently say that this camera is very nice to have. I personally just wanted a film camera with the quality of disposables, and this is absolutely perfect.  BUILD QUALITY Now as you could guess, the camera itself doesn't have a great build quality, it's pretty much plastic, which wasn't an issue for me, but I know could turn off some buyers to it. The leather and the part above it feel nice to the touch though. One small complaint I do have though is that the battery compartment is a bit sensitive and just grazing it could open it. But I solved the issue by slightly changing where I put my left thumb on the camera.  FLASH The flash itself needs a AAA battery and works great. It's very bright and gets the job done for painting the subjects in the dark from about six feet away I'd say. To turn on the flash, you sort of have to spin the border around the lens, there's a spot to grab on to for your nail right at the top, to make it easy. It's also pretty much impossible to turn the flash on and off by accident.  LOADING/UNLOADING Loading the film is very easy on this, as you just pretty much put it in there and wind it up until you hear that first click. SUPER IMPORTANT, when unloading, don't forget to click down the rewind button near the battery compartment before unwinding the film. If it unclicks itself during the process, just press it again then it should stay for sure.  VIEWFINDER/EXPOSURE COUNT The biggest issue that I have with this camera is the exposure count, as it is more difficult to view than other cameras. I'm not sure why they made it that way, but it is what it is. I don't really worry about it as I have 36 exposure rolls I use (which turn to 72) and always have a spare with me. The viewfinder has little meshlike blocks on the left and right sides, to show what will be taken out of the shot.  SHOOTING TIPS I got my film back and it is safe to say that this thing performs really well outdoors on a sunny day. I like the softness and the grain on the images I got back. One note that I will add, is to ALWAYS use flash indoors unless there is a good amount of natural sunlight and use flash when it's not sunny outside. Even if it's light out, if it isn't bright, use flash if capturing subjects. I included an example of what it looks like when you shot in low light without flash (I was using a roll of Kodacolor Ultra Max 400).  CLOSING REMARKS I think this is an excellent camera for the price and if you want an alternative to disposables. It's really easy to just pass the camera to a friend who is inexperienced with this camera, as it's pretty much wind, point, and shoot.

I would recommend to anyone wanting to try film photography without breaking the bank', 'I bought this camera in July 2024 to us when traveling. I really loved the design and the half frame which allowed me to take double the photos as I normally would. This definitely reduces the ability to capture full photos (you’d need to back up quite far to get larger groups of people) but it honestly wasn’t a huge issue.  I’ve shot about 3 rolls since getting this camera so about 216 photos. Photos turned out great, but the scrolling wheel completely broke the last time I used it. It won’t move forward or backwards and the little film stop button under it is also jammed. Without the scroll wheel working, I can’t even load a new roll of film in. I’m pretty bummed because I love this camera but in the end it wasn’t worth the money for only 6 months of moderate use.', \"This is a very cheap-feeling chunk of plastic. The style is a nifty-looking throwback but the quality of the build is barely above single-use disposable film cameras. Certainly the quality doesn't justify a price $35-$50 (at the time of purchase Sept. 2023, depending on the model).  The half-frame photos are a great idea to eke the most out of expensive 35mm film + processing.  As a fixed-focus camera, nothing is ever really in crisp focus. Also there is a significant tilt-shift look to every photo. The center is focused but the periphery is blurred. This is kind of a problem for a photographer who would prefer a focused image with the option to add effects later, either in optical printing or after scanning.  If you are okay with a camera with a licensed-out Kodak brand on it but with none of the original Kodak build heft or quality, then this might be a fun, novel camera for you.\", 'Make sure to use flash when you don’t have a bunch of natural light. This camera works great when you give it the right ingredients to succeed. Produces fun pictures and the 72 picture film count per roll is a very nice perk.', \"I've gone through my fair share of point-and-shoot cameras and this one has been the best by far. While it is made of plastic and therefore feels a bit cheap, it still does the trick and has lasted longer than any of my other plastic cameras.  The best part, however, is that it takes 2 photos per film frame which means you get double the amount of photos. 36 exposures = 72 pictures. film is expensive these days so this is something I can really appreciate.  No complaints over here! Happy customer\", 'Me encanta, tiene el tamaño y peso perfecto para llevarla contigo a todas partes. Las fotografías salen de la mejor calidad. Me parece una excelente opción para empezar con la fotografía análoga. También me gusta que sea half frame pues tienes muchas más fotografías por rollo, además de que se pueden hacer composiciones muy creativas.', 'Conforme à mes attentes', 'Très bien', 'Léger, simple,

It's super durable, very easy to use, and he feels so grown up that he can zoom, use the flash, and take photos and video. Highly recommend for kids who are interested in photos and want a durable first camera!\", 'While the display isn’t the best, this little camera takes nice photos underwater, and in salt water. No issues with leaking and it held its charge really well. You can see the quality of your photos after you download them to a device that has a better display. And regular photos look great too. I did have a difficult time focusing on some objects underwater but that could be user error and some practice is needed.', 'I bought this camera for use in an industrial work setting in a fairly harsh environment. Being waterproof, dustproof, and shockproof is pretty important in this role as even weather-sealed DSLRs and superzooms cannot withstand the conditions that this camera can take. In this role the camera works well, especially for the price.  The specifications for the camera are adequate for its use to take pictures, but don\\'t expect the quality that you\\'d expect from a midrange prosumer DSLR or mirrorless camera. It has an effective 35mm focal length of 27 mm to 108 mm and a 4x optical zoom, but using it out to 4x is difficult without the use of a tripod. It has an aperture of f/3.0 to f/6.6, so it isn\\'t optimal for low light conditions but works fine for outdoor use until twilight. It has 16 Megapixels, but this doesn\\'t matter too much unless you\\'re printing large images. It has a pretty small 1/2.3\" BSI CMOS sensor.  Pros:  Excellent weatherproofing: The particular use case for this camera allows it to operate in conditions that would otherwise destroy a camera. It is waterproof up to 15 m (49 ft), shockproof up to 2 m (6 ft), and dustproof IP6X. I use it an in extremely chemically dusty environment that quickly corrodes exposed contacts. This camera performs spectacularly in this environment due to its design. It doesn\\'t have the left-right command zoom nor a rotating command button interface like in a lot of prosumer cameras, but this is a good thing for weatherproofing. If the camera gets dirty you can just rinse it off with water which is fantastic. Being completely enclosed without a separate lens means you don\\'t need to worry about sensor contamination or cleaning the inside of lenses. The bottom cover is sealed with a rubber gasket to prevent water ingress into the battery compartment during use.  Sharp Lens: The focus on this camera is excellent and provides a very sharp focus, particularly in Macro mode. It can provide a large amount of detail provided that the focus is what you want it to be (which can be tricky). The Macro mode works well here and can focus on close range objects without too much difficulty other than the exact focal point due to the limitations of the LCD display resolution.  Intuitive Interface: There aren\\'t a huge amount of bells and whistles in the UX/UI interface and this simplifies the overall operation. The command console is just the standard buttons (macro, delete, flash, display). The buttons are simple for zoom (out and in) and playback / recording. There is one button for shooting mode and one for the menu. Taking pictures uses the single button on the top right of the camera. There is a small drawback here in that the various modes (Auto / Program / Manual / Landscape etc.) are embedded within the UI and not in a separate command dial. It doesn\\'t have a separate Aperture Priority / Shutter Priority that you\\'d find in prosumer cameras but the Manual mode does allow some more precise control than other point-and-shoots with EV compensation up to ± 3 EV with 1/3 step increments. It also allows for white balance control. The camera has the standard options for time-delay pictures so you can be in the frame or if you\\'re using a tripod to stabilize the camera.  Portable: This camera is fairly small and can easily fit in a shirt pocket. The included wrist strap makes it easy to keep on you to prevent it from accidentally dropping. I like that the wrist strap connection is metal and not plastic and seems sturdy. Images can be reviewed fairly easily on your phone using the  Non-Proprietary Codecs: Pictures are taken in the universal .jpg format and movies in .mov format. This allows it to be displayed on practically all devices without needing to convert it. It doesn\\'t have RAW capability though so post-processing can be a bit limited.  Decent WiFi: Connecting to it with your phone is fairly straightforward once you have the PIXPRO Remote Viewer, and you can use it to take basic pictures (basically the shutter button) remotely and review images on your phone screen (which will likely be better than using the integral LCD).  Decent Battery Life: No complaints here, but not a lot to say either. During normal use it can give you a good 2 hours or so of frequent picture taking before needing a recharge. This is on par with other cameras of its class. Charging is done by opening the bottom cover and, while the battery is inside, connecting a mini USB-A connector (included).  Bright Flash: The forward-mounted integrated flash is pretty bright. You can\\'t aim it in any way and there is no diffusion. It can help offset some of the low light performance but it can blow out the white balance some of the images if you\\'re not careful.  Price: For what it can do, it is very competitively priced for its feature set and its weatherproofing capability. It doesn\\'t have all of the advanced bells and whistles, nor the best specs, but for most people it should be \"good enough.\"  Cons:  Difficult Focusing: While the lens does focus sharply, it can be difficult to get it to focus exactly on what you want. Part of this problem is due to the small, poor resolution LCD display. Often you can\\'t really tell if the picture is focused to your satisfaction until post when you can review it on your computer. There is also some lag on the display that is noticeable when moving or rotating the camera. It lacks an electronic viewfinder so you\\'re completely reliant on the rear LCD display for composition and image review.  Poor Image Stabilization: The image stabilization isn\\'t great and you need an incredibly steady hand when taking pictures in medium to low light conditions (such as indoors) otherwise you\\'ll get some blurry images. This often means in practice having to retake images which can be frustrating.  Poor Low-Light Conditions: This is an issue that isn\\'t unique to cameras with the small 1/2.3\" sensor size, but is particularly noticeable with the poor image stabilization. The auto and program features attempt to counter this by bumping up the ISO and manages to choose an appropriate speed to maintain a balanced exposure. The standard advice applies here: use a tripod when possible and a time-delay for low-light conditions.  Small LCD and Poor Resolution: The LCD (2.7 in with 230k pixels) is not super great for image review. It is fine for composing pictures if you can get past the movement lag. When taking pictures in Macro mode it can be difficult to review where the precise focus is located.  Limited microSD Capacity: This camera only accepts microSDHC cards up to 32 GB. This isn\\'t a lot compared to what you can get these days in 2023, but provides ~7500 or so Fine quality images. The bottleneck will be the battery. However, 32 GB microSD cards are super cheap and you can carry a lot of them around.  Conclusion: This is a pretty good camera for use in harsh environments, but be aware that it isn\\'t perfect in every situation. It should work well though for family vacation pictures where you don\\'t want to constantly worry about getting sand everywhere since all it needs is a simple rinse to clean it.

The app to use with this is also the most useless thing ever. The app has no menu or features. Can't connect to Wi-Fi even though there is an option but good luck trying to figure out how to set it up. The Manuel is absolutely the most useless thing ever. It gives you instructions but they don't help in anyway. Nothing really on you tube. I honestly suggest saving up and buying a Cannon camera. I wish I never lost mine. Cannon is the hands down the best user friendly camera on the planet. This camera is not... I ended up taking pictures of the pictures I took from my phone and editing them that way. So inconvenient in every way. NO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. !!!! WASTE OF MONEY.\", 'Bought for someone interested in photography as a starter camera, and they loved it!', \" I like how small and lightweight this camera is, and it does produce fairly good pictures and video, along with decent audio. Unfortunately I quickly realized that this camera is better suited for snorkeling than SCUBA. I took it on my most recent trip to Playa De Carmen, and used it on roughly 8 dives. Each time when I reached about 32'/10m depth the buttons no longer depress. Most of my dives averaged about 38', and so I had to squeeze with a mighty force to activate the camera. Even when I could get it to begin video, often the video would stop because the pressure caused the button to depress multiple times.  Long story short, if you snorkel or take pictures in the pool, this camera is great, but if infesting in something for SCUBA, this will be a pass. Which is sad because it's one of the more affordable underwater cameras. Read more\", \"I bought this as a backup camera for travelling, not wanting to spend the several hundred dollars more I spent on my primary camera. Initial tests seemed to produce fuzzy pictures and I emailed the company to ask. I got an extremely prompt and helpful reply. By going back to factory default settings and pressing the button slowly - halfway down, wait for teh click, wait for the focus rectangle to turn green, then finish pressing the button - I'm getting excellent pictures. There are a lot of settings available and I'm still learning to use them. It won't shoot clear pictures as fast as my much more expensive camera, but for the price I think it is an outstanding camera, and I think having a good help desk is a major plus.\", \"My son (12) took this on his first cruise. It's definitely waterproof, as he took videos going down the water slides, and drop proof, as he is a little clumsy. It was the perfect size for taking everywhere and he loved getting his own set of pictures of the things he wanted to remember from the trip. Highly recommend. (And he loved the bright blue color, too!)\", 'No puedo conectarla a wifi y no puedo enviar fotos ni videos.', 'Lo uso para tomar fotos de trabajos concluidos y comprobar al cliente el antes y el después.', 'Pedi na quarta de manhã e chegou no domingo de manhã. Linda máquina, cabe na palma da mão e tem excelentes fotos. Fiquei muito satisfeito.', 'Bought for a trip to the azores. Great underwater pictures. Has full manual mode like an DSLR. Requires a 32GB memory card', 'Poor quality of construction and poor quality of image. Never buy this item. After 2 minutes underwater it stop working. And it was perfectly close. Bad product! I was a fool to believe in Kodak, this brand is out! You can’t use it in water and it’s absolutely useless to take picture out of water, and old iPhone 1 do better in quality… It just amazing to sell such a bad product nowadays…'], 'Image':

Good quality camera.', 'Lens cap keeps falling off, seems to be missing two of the felt pads', \"Pros: I have used many different cameras over the years. I previously bought a camera (Kodak 26X still works fine) like this about 15 years ago and now with a better zoom and technology I decided to buy the newest version. This zoom is so nice. We live were there are birds and wildlife and love being able to get some nice photos without breaking out the big camera changing lenses and then putting it all away when done. Easy to carry around. Light weight. Overall a great camera for the money. Lots of photo options for different scenarios. Cons: Doesn't have the second button for vertical photo. The lens cap isn't secured in place with a click like my old camera. Therefor the lens cap comes off quite easily so be sure to use the string attachment so you don't lose it.\", 'I owned a similar Kodak camera many years ago, so I thought this would be a great camera for my trip to Alaska. Wrong. So glad I had my phone camera for a back up. As far as ease of use, sure it was fairly simple to operate. Settings were not too complex to figure out. But the picture quality is just terrible. It wouldn’t focus 90% of the time. I tried and tried to adjust the settings, nothing helped. I finally gave up the hopes of getting any kind of quality picture out of this camera. The Kodak brand did not live up to the standard it once had.', 'good product', 'Bought this as a first camera for my wife. She loves taking pictures so she’d always take my phone as it has a better camera. So I decided to buy her this $185 camera as a gift expecting it to at least match the camera of her iPhone 11, with a better zoom. Boy was I wrong. I’ve attached a picture to the review, just look at it, a half-baked potato would’ve done a better job. iPhone 11 photo beside it for comparison.  Perhaps photographers are gonna laugh at me and ask what I expected. But let this be a caution for beginners like me – save yourself from a headache, don’t buy this camera. Phones probably do a better job at this price point anyways, don’t bother and get a more expensive option straight away or just keep taking iPhone pictures', 'What a fantastic little camera!

What an awesome company to listen to its customers and make adjustments! I can not wait to give an update on my new improved kodak H35N! The original H35 is great and I dont expect anything less from the new updated version. So Im changing my review to 4 stars for customer service and after using the camera I hope to change it to 5 😊  There is a but! So I have the first edition the ektar H35 and love it and the results. So I was so excited to get this one before they sold out! But!! Ok so first thoughts, the pink is not very pink, the flash control and filter is hard to turn on but the flash seems to charge much faster and looks brighter and isn’t draining batteries. The sad news is that my 24exp roll of film refued to advance 3 times. 3 times I have had to take the camera into the dark and open the back to loosen the film so It could be advanced. I don’t have the results of the. Images yet. But I do like the idea of the added features, the star filter and the bulb mode. I made sure to use all the features on my roll to see what this camera can do. I will try another roll and if it sticks as well I will be returning this one. This new edition does have an “easier” loading method but I’m wondering if that is what is causing the problem? I never had film stick in the first edition, ektar h35 no “N”. Maybe I just got a dud or there was a loading issue. So 3 stars because film sticks but it is compact and a fun camera. I’m just hoping this is a one time incident or if I get another it will work as well as the first edition.

I've injured my hand and nails trying to switch the flash on, but maybe its for the better that I couldn't since I would have not been able to turn it off :(((  I guess I will only be using this camera during the day </3\", 'Tolle Kamera mit einem erstaunlich qualitativ hochwertigen Objektiv. Die Bilder sind scharf (leichte Unschärfe im den Ecken) und die Farben brillant. Hervorragendes Preisleistungsverhältnis.

maker of this camera has reached out to me and I will be receiving a revised replacement for this camera! What an awesome company to listen to its customers and make adjustments! I can not wait to give an update on my new improved kodak H35N! The original H35 is great and I dont expect anything less from the new updated version. So Im changing my review to 4 stars for customer service and after using the camera I hope to change it to 5 😊  There is a but! So I have the first edition the ektar H35 and love it and the results. So I was so excited to get this one before they sold out! But!! Ok so first thoughts, the pink is not very pink, the flash control and filter is hard to turn on but the flash seems to charge much faster and looks brighter and isn’t draining batteries. The sad news is that my 24exp roll of film refued to advance 3 times. 3 times I have had to take the camera into the dark and open the back to loosen the film so It could be advanced. I don’t have the results of the. Images yet. But I do like the idea of the added features, the star filter and the bulb mode. I made sure to use all the features on my roll to see what this camera can do. I will try another roll and if it sticks as well I will be returning this one. This new edition does have an “easier” loading method but I’m wondering if that is what is causing the problem? I never had film stick in the first edition, ektar h35 no “N”. Maybe I just got a dud or there was a loading issue. So 3 stars because film sticks but it is compact and a fun camera. I’m just hoping this is a one time incident or if I get another it will work as well as the first edition.

I've injured my hand and nails trying to switch the flash on, but maybe its for the better that I couldn't since I would have not been able to turn it off :(((  I guess I will only be using this camera during the day </3\", 'Tolle Kamera mit einem erstaunlich qualitativ hochwertigen Objektiv.

Many people say that it isn't worth it, and with the development of quality in phone cameras, why even bother buying a digital one that provides less quality photos than that of your phone, that almost everyone has and carries with them at all times? I personally like having a compact, portable camera that is less of an investment than an expensive smart phone in the case it gets stolen, dropped, damaged, etc. This in itself is an appeal for me to purchase a digital camera to use instead of my iPhone. It was a great alternative to my phone, allowing me to keep my phone tucked away in a pocket or a bag, while still being able to take photographs while on my trips. I really liked the red color offered, as I try to buy everything red. The camera itself is compact and portable, it was super easy to conceal and travel with, adding little weight to my travel bags. The camera is very easy to use, allowing different shooting settings, zoom, and even video recordings. The battery lasts quite a while too, but I bought secondary batteries just in case. I also really appreciate the fact the camera utilizes a rechargeable battery, so you can charge it on trips when you have a break and you don't have to be constantly carrying a set of AAs. The picture quality itself is high, in my personal opinion, really good for the price that you're paying and the compactness of the camera. The video quality could be better, but is decent for the size and price of the camera. If you're zooming in a lot, the video quality is obviously compensated, and the audio quality in videos isn't the best, but. You get what you pay for, and in this case, you actually get better. It's well worth the money, providing video-recording abilities and high quality photographs. I highly recommend this camera for anybody looking for a camera for the same purposes as I. It's well worth the money and has exceeded my expectations in performance. It would also be a great starter camera for someone looking for a simple point-and-shoot camera, or for adolescents looking to get into the camera/photography community. Obviously if you're a professional photographer, I wouldn't recommend this camera, but I doubt anybody professional is looking to take high-quality, professional photographs with a simple point-and-shoot camera. For the price, quality, and performance, this camera is well worth the money, and I highly recommend it!(: Read more\", 'I purchased the Kodak pixPro FZ55 for several reasons: a) I needed a smaller camera that took up less space in my luggage and/or travel backpack; b) used Li-ion rechargeable batteries that could be charged either in the camera or in a small charger; c) took good photos, day or night, of people, buildings, and scenery; d) took good video using 32 or 64 GB SD cards; and e) cost less than $150.00 (for a point and shoot camera!). I received my camera in three working days, opened the box, read the instruction manual, charged the battery (comes partially charged), and put the camera through its paces for a week.  Likes and Dislikes: Look at the comparison photo of my \"normal-sized\" DSLR with carrying strap and regular lens, and the Kodak next to it. Camera fits in my hand. When I travel internationally, usually eight to ten days, I do not use checked luggage; I use only a backpack carry-on that actually fits in the overhead without being offensive to fellow passengers. To do that, the choice in cameras is obvious. Why not just use my cell phone? Because of the increasing number of folks who have lost \\'em, dropped \\'em, or had \\'em stolen. Camera setup using on-screen prompts easy to understand and follow, menu choices easy to ascertain and follow too. Camera takes good photos outdoors as seen in several of the other photos. Zoom (telephoto) capability is average, as seen by the two photos with the white building and vehicles in the distance. Camera doesn\\'t compensate well when too much light is coming in as seen in one photo with bright vegetation and tree shadows, but that can be adjusted with better technique and composition. Macro photos tend to be \"flat\", as seen in one photo, but I expected that without f-stop adjustments or using a tripod. Again, use of better technique would probably help. Also need to think about space and weight in the travel bag.  Zoom is smooth with normal low buzzing sound found in higher-priced point and shoot cameras. LCD screen is small, but I expected that because of the overall smallness of the camera. For me, I can still see the screen image fine. Indoor photos with flash are passable, but one must be close to subject due to reduced flash output. Flash turns \"on\" and \"off\" easily. Timer works well, 2s &10s delay with audible beep when ready to shoot. Use caution and a careful touch when opening the camera to insert or retrieve SD card and/or battery located in same slot, and check that camera is OFF when trying to access the port, located on the bottom corner. Read more', 'I have to say that overall this little camera is good. There is a definite lag between pressing the button to take a photo and hearing the click which means it has happened. Be sure you allow yourself a little extra time before moving the camera. The photos are pretty good/sharp/clear. I have not printed any. I would have preferred a written book of instructions as opposed to a downloaded version. I\\'m not sure that this camera is any better than the cheaper \"kid\" cameras. I went with it because of the brand name. It is good for nonprofessional results, a starter camera, or to use until you decide if you want a better camera or a phone with an amazing camera built in. I have used it to take oddball photos of things that most people would not notice and it has worked ok for those. Again, the lag in pressing the button and taking the picture is a bit annoying. Make sure when you order any accessories that they are for this model.', 'Great simple point and click camera. Pictures is of good quality. It is obviously not a professional camera but it great for someone who has trouble working complicated controls.', \"I purchased this to replace an old Sony Cybershot, and I had to return it. It is cute, lightweight, and super easy to use right out of the box, but the picture quality is horrible. I took the same picture with my old Sony Cybershot and this camera, and the picture from this camera was somehow both pixelated and fuzzy. The zoom feature does not seem to work properly and produce clear photos. Even though I'm not a professional photographer, I want pictures of family vacations to look halfway decent and this does not do that. I think that I got better pictures with an iPhone 6.  Overall, if you want decent photos, don't buy this - the picture quality is atrocious.\", 'Estilo retro. Muy padre. Recomendable y excelente precio por tan buen producto', 'Com dois usos o zoom da câmera travou e ela só desliga se tirar a bateria. Além disso, ao coloca-la para carregar aparece que a ligação falhou e a bateria permanece baixa após horas carregando', 'Fairly easy to use.Instructions could have been a little more detailed.', 'Easy to use, convenient charger', 'Camera worked well with no issues.

Good quality camera.', 'Lens cap keeps falling off, seems to be missing two of the felt pads', \"Pros: I have used many different cameras over the years. I previously bought a camera (Kodak 26X still works fine) like this about 15 years ago and now with a better zoom and technology I decided to buy the newest version. This zoom is so nice. We live were there are birds and wildlife and love being able to get some nice photos without breaking out the big camera changing lenses and then putting it all away when done. Easy to carry around. Light weight. Overall a great camera for the money. Lots of photo options for different scenarios. Cons: Doesn't have the second button for vertical photo. The lens cap isn't secured in place with a click like my old camera. Therefor the lens cap comes off quite easily so be sure to use the string attachment so you don't lose it.\", 'I owned a similar Kodak camera many years ago, so I thought this would be a great camera for my trip to Alaska. Wrong. So glad I had my phone camera for a back up. As far as ease of use, sure it was fairly simple to operate. Settings were not too complex to figure out. But the picture quality is just terrible. It wouldn’t focus 90% of the time. I tried and tried to adjust the settings, nothing helped. I finally gave up the hopes of getting any kind of quality picture out of this camera. The Kodak brand did not live up to the standard it once had.', 'good product', 'Bought this as a first camera for my wife. She loves taking pictures so she’d always take my phone as it has a better camera. So I decided to buy her this $185 camera as a gift expecting it to at least match the camera of her iPhone 11, with a better zoom. Boy was I wrong. I’ve attached a picture to the review, just look at it, a half-baked potato would’ve done a better job. iPhone 11 photo beside it for comparison.  Perhaps photographers are gonna laugh at me and ask what I expected. But let this be a caution for beginners like me – save yourself from a headache, don’t buy this camera. Phones probably do a better job at this price point anyways, don’t bother and get a more expensive option straight away or just keep taking iPhone pictures', 'What a fantastic little camera!

It's super durable, very easy to use, and he feels so grown up that he can zoom, use the flash, and take photos and video. Highly recommend for kids who are interested in photos and want a durable first camera!\", 'While the display isn’t the best, this little camera takes nice photos underwater, and in salt water. No issues with leaking and it held its charge really well. You can see the quality of your photos after you download them to a device that has a better display. And regular photos look great too. I did have a difficult time focusing on some objects underwater but that could be user error and some practice is needed.', 'I bought this camera for use in an industrial work setting in a fairly harsh environment. Being waterproof, dustproof, and shockproof is pretty important in this role as even weather-sealed DSLRs and superzooms cannot withstand the conditions that this camera can take. In this role the camera works well, especially for the price.  The specifications for the camera are adequate for its use to take pictures, but don\\'t expect the quality that you\\'d expect from a midrange prosumer DSLR or mirrorless camera. It has an effective 35mm focal length of 27 mm to 108 mm and a 4x optical zoom, but using it out to 4x is difficult without the use of a tripod. It has an aperture of f/3.0 to f/6.6, so it isn\\'t optimal for low light conditions but works fine for outdoor use until twilight. It has 16 Megapixels, but this doesn\\'t matter too much unless you\\'re printing large images. It has a pretty small 1/2.3\" BSI CMOS sensor.  Pros:  Excellent weatherproofing: The particular use case for this camera allows it to operate in conditions that would otherwise destroy a camera. It is waterproof up to 15 m (49 ft), shockproof up to 2 m (6 ft), and dustproof IP6X. I use it an in extremely chemically dusty environment that quickly corrodes exposed contacts. This camera performs spectacularly in this environment due to its design. It doesn\\'t have the left-right command zoom nor a rotating command button interface like in a lot of prosumer cameras, but this is a good thing for weatherproofing. If the camera gets dirty you can just rinse it off with water which is fantastic. Being completely enclosed without a separate lens means you don\\'t need to worry about sensor contamination or cleaning the inside of lenses. The bottom cover is sealed with a rubber gasket to prevent water ingress into the battery compartment during use.  Sharp Lens: The focus on this camera is excellent and provides a very sharp focus, particularly in Macro mode. It can provide a large amount of detail provided that the focus is what you want it to be (which can be tricky). The Macro mode works well here and can focus on close range objects without too much difficulty other than the exact focal point due to the limitations of the LCD display resolution.  Intuitive Interface: There aren\\'t a huge amount of bells and whistles in the UX/UI interface and this simplifies the overall operation. The command console is just the standard buttons (macro, delete, flash, display). The buttons are simple for zoom (out and in) and playback / recording. There is one button for shooting mode and one for the menu. Taking pictures uses the single button on the top right of the camera. There is a small drawback here in that the various modes (Auto / Program / Manual / Landscape etc.) are embedded within the UI and not in a separate command dial. It doesn\\'t have a separate Aperture Priority / Shutter Priority that you\\'d find in prosumer cameras but the Manual mode does allow some more precise control than other point-and-shoots with EV compensation up to ± 3 EV with 1/3 step increments. It also allows for white balance control. The camera has the standard options for time-delay pictures so you can be in the frame or if you\\'re using a tripod to stabilize the camera.  Portable: This camera is fairly small and can easily fit in a shirt pocket. The included wrist strap makes it easy to keep on you to prevent it from accidentally dropping. I like that the wrist strap connection is metal and not plastic and seems sturdy. Images can be reviewed fairly easily on your phone using the  Non-Proprietary Codecs: Pictures are taken in the universal .jpg format and movies in .mov format. This allows it to be displayed on practically all devices without needing to convert it. It doesn\\'t have RAW capability though so post-processing can be a bit limited.  Decent WiFi: Connecting to it with your phone is fairly straightforward once you have the PIXPRO Remote Viewer, and you can use it to take basic pictures (basically the shutter button) remotely and review images on your phone screen (which will likely be better than using the integral LCD).  Decent Battery Life: No complaints here, but not a lot to say either. During normal use it can give you a good 2 hours or so of frequent picture taking before needing a recharge. This is on par with other cameras of its class. Charging is done by opening the bottom cover and, while the battery is inside, connecting a mini USB-A connector (included).  Bright Flash: The forward-mounted integrated flash is pretty bright. You can\\'t aim it in any way and there is no diffusion. It can help offset some of the low light performance but it can blow out the white balance some of the images if you\\'re not careful.  Price: For what it can do, it is very competitively priced for its feature set and its weatherproofing capability. It doesn\\'t have all of the advanced bells and whistles, nor the best specs, but for most people it should be \"good enough.\"  Cons:  Difficult Focusing: While the lens does focus sharply, it can be difficult to get it to focus exactly on what you want. Part of this problem is due to the small, poor resolution LCD display. Often you can\\'t really tell if the picture is focused to your satisfaction until post when you can review it on your computer. There is also some lag on the display that is noticeable when moving or rotating the camera. It lacks an electronic viewfinder so you\\'re completely reliant on the rear LCD display for composition and image review.  Poor Image Stabilization: The image stabilization isn\\'t great and you need an incredibly steady hand when taking pictures in medium to low light conditions (such as indoors) otherwise you\\'ll get some blurry images. This often means in practice having to retake images which can be frustrating.  Poor Low-Light Conditions: This is an issue that isn\\'t unique to cameras with the small 1/2.3\" sensor size, but is particularly noticeable with the poor image stabilization. The auto and program features attempt to counter this by bumping up the ISO and manages to choose an appropriate speed to maintain a balanced exposure. The standard advice applies here: use a tripod when possible and a time-delay for low-light conditions.  Small LCD and Poor Resolution: The LCD (2.7 in with 230k pixels) is not super great for image review. It is fine for composing pictures if you can get past the movement lag. When taking pictures in Macro mode it can be difficult to review where the precise focus is located.  Limited microSD Capacity: This camera only accepts microSDHC cards up to 32 GB. This isn\\'t a lot compared to what you can get these days in 2023, but provides ~7500 or so Fine quality images. The bottleneck will be the battery. However, 32 GB microSD cards are super cheap and you can carry a lot of them around.  Conclusion: This is a pretty good camera for use in harsh environments, but be aware that it isn\\'t perfect in every situation. It should work well though for family vacation pictures where you don\\'t want to constantly worry about getting sand everywhere since all it needs is a simple rinse to clean it.

The app to use with this is also the most useless thing ever. The app has no menu or features. Can't connect to Wi-Fi even though there is an option but good luck trying to figure out how to set it up. The Manuel is absolutely the most useless thing ever. It gives you instructions but they don't help in anyway. Nothing really on you tube. I honestly suggest saving up and buying a Cannon camera. I wish I never lost mine. Cannon is the hands down the best user friendly camera on the planet. This camera is not... I ended up taking pictures of the pictures I took from my phone and editing them that way. So inconvenient in every way. NO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. !!!! WASTE OF MONEY.\", 'Bought for someone interested in photography as a starter camera, and they loved it!', \" I like how small and lightweight this camera is, and it does produce fairly good pictures and video, along with decent audio. Unfortunately I quickly realized that this camera is better suited for snorkeling than SCUBA. I took it on my most recent trip to Playa De Carmen, and used it on roughly 8 dives. Each time when I reached about 32'/10m depth the buttons no longer depress. Most of my dives averaged about 38', and so I had to squeeze with a mighty force to activate the camera. Even when I could get it to begin video, often the video would stop because the pressure caused the button to depress multiple times.  Long story short, if you snorkel or take pictures in the pool, this camera is great, but if infesting in something for SCUBA, this will be a pass. Which is sad because it's one of the more affordable underwater cameras. Read more\", \"I bought this as a backup camera for travelling, not wanting to spend the several hundred dollars more I spent on my primary camera. Initial tests seemed to produce fuzzy pictures and I emailed the company to ask. I got an extremely prompt and helpful reply. By going back to factory default settings and pressing the button slowly - halfway down, wait for teh click, wait for the focus rectangle to turn green, then finish pressing the button - I'm getting excellent pictures. There are a lot of settings available and I'm still learning to use them. It won't shoot clear pictures as fast as my much more expensive camera, but for the price I think it is an outstanding camera, and I think having a good help desk is a major plus.\", \"My son (12) took this on his first cruise. It's definitely waterproof, as he took videos going down the water slides, and drop proof, as he is a little clumsy. It was the perfect size for taking everywhere and he loved getting his own set of pictures of the things he wanted to remember from the trip. Highly recommend. (And he loved the bright blue color, too!)\", 'No puedo conectarla a wifi y no puedo enviar fotos ni videos.', 'Lo uso para tomar fotos de trabajos concluidos y comprobar al cliente el antes y el después.', 'Pedi na quarta de manhã e chegou no domingo de manhã. Linda máquina, cabe na palma da mão e tem excelentes fotos. Fiquei muito satisfeito.', 'Bought for a trip to the azores. Great underwater pictures. Has full manual mode like an DSLR. Requires a 32GB memory card', 'Poor quality of construction and poor quality of image. Never buy this item. After 2 minutes underwater it stop working. And it was perfectly close. Bad product! I was a fool to believe in Kodak, this brand is out! You can’t use it in water and it’s absolutely useless to take picture out of water, and old iPhone 1 do better in quality… It just amazing to sell such a bad product nowadays…'], 'Image':

My cell phone might be in my car and it's usually not even charged. I wanted this camera to carry in purse to whip out at any time to get pictures of my grandchildren just like I used to with my children 25 years ago, except this camera is far superior to my old one. It is easy to handle, comes with easy directions, and produces sharp, crystal clear images. Great buy for the money!\", \"I got the new Kodak AZ401BK today, put batteries and an SD card in it and started experimenting to see how well I liked it. For the money, I'd say its a pretty nice camera. The battery/SD card door is a little flimsy, just as another review stated. But the flash, the zoom and the screen quality are superb. The auto focus works well too. The controls are intuitive and nicely sized. The camera is a good size and weight. The grip and neck strap are comfortable. I got this camera, mostly, for improved still images. It does a good job of that. It does not do great video. Its OK, but not great. To put it plainly: It misses 5 stars for two reasons: 1) flimsy battery door and 2) poor video quality. If you aren't relying on this camera to shoot video then I'd say: Get it!\", 'Easy workability. Set it, point and shoot! Pictures are clear and easy to print.', \"I have had many cameras in my lifetime, really expensive and really cheap. I have NEVER had a camera use battery power like this one. I bought rechargeable batteries and a charger and then bought even additional batteries. If you are using it on a day trip, you had better have the backup batteries with you because this camera won't last. Also, the compartment where you insert the batteries has a slide switch where you lock it so the batteries will stay in. If you handle the camera at all, take it in and out of a bag or even wear it around the neck and hold it, it is very easy to move the slide and the batteries will all fall out. It is very light and the pictures will be blurred if you don't really concentrate and hold it tight. I want something I can swing up in a heartbeat and take a snapshot. This camera will not do it. It does take some good pictures but I can honestly say I can't tell the difference between my phone and the camera. I would say you get what you pay for but I have a small Canon that was half the cost and the pictures are just as good if not better. I only bought this one because I couldn't find my Canon. Thank goodness it showed up.\", 'Le cuesta demasiado o directamente no enfoca a objetos de cerca o de lejos cuando haces zoom ni con trípode se soluciona el problema, tengan en cuenta esto antes de comprar tiene problemas de enfoque bastante graves llevo ya poco de menos de un mes usándola y siendo sincero no la recomendaría, cabe admitir que a veces si se logra fotos muy decentes pero el problema del enfoque es bastante notorio en ciertos campos....', \"This is the third Kodak I've purchased in the last 10 years. The first two were Kodak Share's and were great, but no longer produced. When I say the third camera a person has to realize that I use my camera heavy duty 7 months out of the year. I'm a field appraiser and do real estate tax appraisals for three different counties every year. As I'm doing my work I take pictures of any new structures or anything that would affect value of properties. Often that can mean as many as 50 per day. They took lots of wear & tear but held up really well. The first I dropped on a concrete walk. Needless to say, not the fault of the camera. The last one developed a problem in the spring lever that holds the batteries causing it not to stay closed well. I've spent the last three weeks with packing tape holding it shut! 🤣 Then I decided to try the new PixPro, which I ordered through Amazon with very quick service from the dealer. It's so closely made to my others that I don't think it will take any time to master! And even better magnification! 40x where my others were only 20x. I use this feature a lot as many properties are inaccessible with a normal range. My only problem that is preventing using it right away is the camera to computer downloading. With my previous cameras I could download my pictures with the days pictures dated and numbered 1 through the end. I could delete those pictures then start over the next day with 1 . I've not figured out how to master this and am planning on calling the company for help. Right now, if I delete 12 and delete, the next day will be 13, etc. I know there are lots of $$$cameras out there but for my use, Kodak can't be beat! I'll follow up with my service form the dealer if my concerned can be addressed. Read more\", 'I love this product! Very easy to learn, the images are crystal clear, it’s not too big, so it’s light and easy to take around. Plus I love how slick it looks.', 'La cámara es increíble, la resolución que tiene es muy buena, ciertamente mejora mucho cuando las tomas se hacen con el zoom óptico, los modos de fotografía son muy buenos, el vídeo es sumamente estable y agradable, ninguna de estas fotos tiene edición, sin duda es la mejor opción que pueden tener a la hora de comprar una cámara, puede que al principio no parezca que dará buenos resultados, pero conforme más la usas más te das cuenta de lo buena que es, por su precio estoy asombrado por la excelente calidad que tiene Si debo dar puntos negativos está el tema de la batería, ocupa demasiada y utiliza pilas, las que incorpora no son las mejores, así que vale la pena invertir en unas recargables de almenos 2500mah para que tenga buena duración, pero con el ahorro que tienes al comprarla es más que nada una inversión También las fotografías en la noche no son las mejores, pero no se puede pedir más de lo que ofrece esta cámara, sin duda una gran opción Recomendación. Si compras esta cámara por fuerza necesitarás: Una memoria SD de almenos 32gb Un trípode, uno sencillo basta Un estuche para transportarla con más facilidad, aunque no es algo obligatorio Baterias recargables 2500mah, gasta mucha batería, así aguantará para sesiones largas.

It's easy to use and is reasonably priced and gives great pictures. It comes with a strap, lens, 4 AA starter batteries (which are still good ever 3 weeks of use). I did have to buy a USB cable at Staples for $11.00. I do have two extra sets of AA batteries and charger which is recommended. Over all its a great camera for my backyard photography.\", \"This is a great camera for its price. Fantastic zoom: 40x optical PLUS 4x digital, giving 160x Zoom application. Has a 'green LED ' and audible signal when object is in Focus. Which is useful. Definitely needs as tripod when using super zoom, for steady photos. Some reviews complained about poor battery performance but 2 months on I am still using the original batteries that I fitted. Over 130 photos taken, so far. It has all the usual Digital Camera facilities including Video/ Auto/ Program and other Aperture & Shutter Speed applications.\", 'Die Kamera ist von der Leistung für mich als Hobbyfotograf völlig ausreichend. Sie ist genau wie beschrieben und Preis-Leistung ist für mich unschlagbar gewesen. Ich habe mir auch die EOS 4000D geholt, diese hier ist etwas kleiner und für Bilder beim Wandern und Gassi gehen sehr gut zu händeln bei einer sehr ordentlichen Leistung für Hobbyfotografen und Schnappschussjäger in guter Qualität.'], 'Image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mcXgTbfjL.__AC_SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg', 'Link':

It’s not a professional film camera, so it’s frame is PERFECT for daily use. I keep mine in my tote bag and it’s handled getting tossed around every day and dropped a few times just fine. Very beginner friendly and a great way to get more pictures for your buck!', 'I purchased this camera because I’m going on a trip and wanted to take some pictures that had a vintage feel to them. I’m not a photographer, but I knew with the right roll of film I could get the look I was wanting. Anyhow, I checked out the reviews for this camera and the film suggestions, some reviews included pictures of their developed photos and they looked great. I confidently made my purchase! I feel like you can’t go wrong on the camera itself, just do your research on the film. The camera is plastic essentially, so it’s light weight, that doesn’t bother me very much though. It does have a flash and installing the film was super easy. Also make sure you know of a place that developes film!  Overall the quality is little less than desired, but still a great purchase for me! It’s way cheaper than investing in a fancy schmancy camera and lens when photography isn’t even a hobby of mine lol. This would make a great gift for someone whose interested in photography, or you’re wanting cute photos.', 'I do really enjoy this lightweight camera for outside photography and little memories captured on film. After opening my package I had put in a fresh battery and within two months of having it, I noticed the flash wasn’t turning on. I had only used it up to 50 shots. I changed out the battery and it started to work so I guess I’ll be going through my batteries more often than expected. Other than that the camera has held up and it super lightweight and would be a cute gift for someone starting out with photography or just a cute little camera to have for fun!', \"I'm still relatively new to film photography but, I can confidently say that this camera is very nice to have. I personally just wanted a film camera with the quality of disposables, and this is absolutely perfect.  BUILD QUALITY Now as you could guess, the camera itself doesn't have a great build quality, it's pretty much plastic, which wasn't an issue for me, but I know could turn off some buyers to it. The leather and the part above it feel nice to the touch though. One small complaint I do have though is that the battery compartment is a bit sensitive and just grazing it could open it. But I solved the issue by slightly changing where I put my left thumb on the camera.  FLASH The flash itself needs a AAA battery and works great. It's very bright and gets the job done for painting the subjects in the dark from about six feet away I'd say. To turn on the flash, you sort of have to spin the border around the lens, there's a spot to grab on to for your nail right at the top, to make it easy. It's also pretty much impossible to turn the flash on and off by accident.  LOADING/UNLOADING Loading the film is very easy on this, as you just pretty much put it in there and wind it up until you hear that first click. SUPER IMPORTANT, when unloading, don't forget to click down the rewind button near the battery compartment before unwinding the film. If it unclicks itself during the process, just press it again then it should stay for sure.  VIEWFINDER/EXPOSURE COUNT The biggest issue that I have with this camera is the exposure count, as it is more difficult to view than other cameras. I'm not sure why they made it that way, but it is what it is. I don't really worry about it as I have 36 exposure rolls I use (which turn to 72) and always have a spare with me. The viewfinder has little meshlike blocks on the left and right sides, to show what will be taken out of the shot.  SHOOTING TIPS I got my film back and it is safe to say that this thing performs really well outdoors on a sunny day. I like the softness and the grain on the images I got back. One note that I will add, is to ALWAYS use flash indoors unless there is a good amount of natural sunlight and use flash when it's not sunny outside. Even if it's light out, if it isn't bright, use flash if capturing subjects. I included an example of what it looks like when you shot in low light without flash (I was using a roll of Kodacolor Ultra Max 400).  CLOSING REMARKS I think this is an excellent camera for the price and if you want an alternative to disposables. It's really easy to just pass the camera to a friend who is inexperienced with this camera, as it's pretty much wind, point, and shoot.

I would recommend to anyone wanting to try film photography without breaking the bank', 'I bought this camera in July 2024 to us when traveling. I really loved the design and the half frame which allowed me to take double the photos as I normally would. This definitely reduces the ability to capture full photos (you’d need to back up quite far to get larger groups of people) but it honestly wasn’t a huge issue.  I’ve shot about 3 rolls since getting this camera so about 216 photos. Photos turned out great, but the scrolling wheel completely broke the last time I used it. It won’t move forward or backwards and the little film stop button under it is also jammed. Without the scroll wheel working, I can’t even load a new roll of film in. I’m pretty bummed because I love this camera but in the end it wasn’t worth the money for only 6 months of moderate use.', \"This is a very cheap-feeling chunk of plastic. The style is a nifty-looking throwback but the quality of the build is barely above single-use disposable film cameras. Certainly the quality doesn't justify a price $35-$50 (at the time of purchase Sept. 2023, depending on the model).  The half-frame photos are a great idea to eke the most out of expensive 35mm film + processing.  As a fixed-focus camera, nothing is ever really in crisp focus. Also there is a significant tilt-shift look to every photo. The center is focused but the periphery is blurred. This is kind of a problem for a photographer who would prefer a focused image with the option to add effects later, either in optical printing or after scanning.  If you are okay with a camera with a licensed-out Kodak brand on it but with none of the original Kodak build heft or quality, then this might be a fun, novel camera for you.\", 'Make sure to use flash when you don’t have a bunch of natural light. This camera works great when you give it the right ingredients to succeed. Produces fun pictures and the 72 picture film count per roll is a very nice perk.', \"I've gone through my fair share of point-and-shoot cameras and this one has been the best by far. While it is made of plastic and therefore feels a bit cheap, it still does the trick and has lasted longer than any of my other plastic cameras.  The best part, however, is that it takes 2 photos per film frame which means you get double the amount of photos. 36 exposures = 72 pictures. film is expensive these days so this is something I can really appreciate.  No complaints over here! Happy customer\", 'Me encanta, tiene el tamaño y peso perfecto para llevarla contigo a todas partes. Las fotografías salen de la mejor calidad. Me parece una excelente opción para empezar con la fotografía análoga. También me gusta que sea half frame pues tienes muchas más fotografías por rollo, además de que se pueden hacer composiciones muy creativas.', 'Conforme à mes attentes', 'Très bien', 'Léger, simple,

What an awesome company to listen to its customers and make adjustments! I can not wait to give an update on my new improved kodak H35N! The original H35 is great and I dont expect anything less from the new updated version. So Im changing my review to 4 stars for customer service and after using the camera I hope to change it to 5 😊  There is a but! So I have the first edition the ektar H35 and love it and the results. So I was so excited to get this one before they sold out! But!! Ok so first thoughts, the pink is not very pink, the flash control and filter is hard to turn on but the flash seems to charge much faster and looks brighter and isn’t draining batteries. The sad news is that my 24exp roll of film refued to advance 3 times. 3 times I have had to take the camera into the dark and open the back to loosen the film so It could be advanced. I don’t have the results of the. Images yet. But I do like the idea of the added features, the star filter and the bulb mode. I made sure to use all the features on my roll to see what this camera can do. I will try another roll and if it sticks as well I will be returning this one. This new edition does have an “easier” loading method but I’m wondering if that is what is causing the problem? I never had film stick in the first edition, ektar h35 no “N”. Maybe I just got a dud or there was a loading issue. So 3 stars because film sticks but it is compact and a fun camera. I’m just hoping this is a one time incident or if I get another it will work as well as the first edition.

I've injured my hand and nails trying to switch the flash on, but maybe its for the better that I couldn't since I would have not been able to turn it off :(((  I guess I will only be using this camera during the day </3\", 'Tolle Kamera mit einem erstaunlich qualitativ hochwertigen Objektiv.

maker of this camera has reached out to me and I will be receiving a revised replacement for this camera! What an awesome company to listen to its customers and make adjustments! I can not wait to give an update on my new improved kodak H35N! The original H35 is great and I dont expect anything less from the new updated version. So Im changing my review to 4 stars for customer service and after using the camera I hope to change it to 5 😊  There is a but! So I have the first edition the ektar H35 and love it and the results. So I was so excited to get this one before they sold out! But!! Ok so first thoughts, the pink is not very pink, the flash control and filter is hard to turn on but the flash seems to charge much faster and looks brighter and isn’t draining batteries. The sad news is that my 24exp roll of film refued to advance 3 times. 3 times I have had to take the camera into the dark and open the back to loosen the film so It could be advanced. I don’t have the results of the. Images yet. But I do like the idea of the added features, the star filter and the bulb mode. I made sure to use all the features on my roll to see what this camera can do. I will try another roll and if it sticks as well I will be returning this one. This new edition does have an “easier” loading method but I’m wondering if that is what is causing the problem? I never had film stick in the first edition, ektar h35 no “N”. Maybe I just got a dud or there was a loading issue. So 3 stars because film sticks but it is compact and a fun camera. I’m just hoping this is a one time incident or if I get another it will work as well as the first edition.

I've injured my hand and nails trying to switch the flash on, but maybe its for the better that I couldn't since I would have not been able to turn it off :(((  I guess I will only be using this camera during the day </3\", 'Tolle Kamera mit einem erstaunlich qualitativ hochwertigen Objektiv.

I never had time to read the instruction book for the MP3 or games features - they just jumped to it and started taking photos. The photos are clear enough but not polaroid-style quality (almost gives it an artsy quality, especially when they color in the black & white printouts). Charges easily. Comes with plenty of printing paper, and I like seeing what they choose to take photos of in their little world. Excellent gift for any kid old enough to point & shoot a camera right up to high-school aged.', 'Perfect camera for kids! My daughter loves all the features and it was very easy for her to learn how to function it. She loves that she can instantly print pictures and decorate her cork board full of pictures. Perfect gift for any child thats not quite old enough to be responsible with a real camera just yet.', 'My 5 year old daughter has no trouble navigating the menus, turning printing on and off, and even found the arcade games it has.  She loves the camera and brings it with her everywhere now.  I recommend the dot printing method for the best photo quality.', \"My daughter (8) has been asking for the brand name instant print camera (at 3x the price, and the refills are INSANELY expensive) for a year now, and we thought about getting her this one to see if it actually would be a long-lasting love of hers (her interest in toys has always tended toward flaming out rapidly), and as it turns out, we won't be needing to buy the pricey one because this is an overwhelming success!  She and her brother (5) have been having a ball for nearly a month now playing with all the features and frames and games on this camera, and still haven't exhausted all its possibilities yet! The pictures are good quality, there are so many extras bundled in the box, and you get a lot of bang for your buck insofar as the number of pictures per refill (Protip: buy a bundle of paper rolls when you buy this camera, they will still find a way to use them up faster than you can have new ones shipped!)  I can't believe how much fun my kids have had with this camera. Awesome value for the money. We have bought a second one for my son for Christmas, and can't wait to surprise him with it.\", 'This is a perfect camera for my four year old. It takes decent photos given its just heat. It is easy to use and the battery lasts a while. My only complant is it can be a little hard to rip the photo off and so my four year old ends up pulling the whole roll out.', 'I got this gift for my daughter for Christmas because she loves taking pictures on my phone. I’d recommend playing around with the settings because you can see the difference in the pictures I tested just by changing printing density & printing type! I recommend using DOT print. This camera would even be great for adults. I have a Polaroid camera and haven’t used it more than a few times because the cost of film. This comes with so much extra rolls of film! Also what I love about this is that it saves the pictures so you can make multiple copies! So if you don’t like the quality of the photo you can always mess with the settings and print it again! Only thing I would change is for there to be an option for printing in color!', \"I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter for Christmas along with an extra supply of thermal printing paper. It was easy to set up and she was able to grasp how to use it very quickly. Mom and dad won't have to worry about buying expensive film for this instant print camera.  It does print in black and white but the quality is good. My granddaughter loves to color so she will have fun coloring in her pictures.

Both cameras turn on and seem fine, but when you take a picture and try to access it, the camera freezes. You have to continually power off the camera to be able to do anything, then it freezes again. My biggest problem is that I bought these in October as Christmas gifts and they didn't get opened till Christmas and now I can't return them. A complete waste of money! Honestly find a different camera to buy, these don't work.\",\n",

Both cameras turn on and seem fine, but when you take a picture and try to access it, the camera freezes. You have to continually power off the camera to be able to do anything, then it freezes again. My biggest problem is that I bought these in October as Christmas gifts and they didn't get opened till Christmas and now I can't return them. A complete waste of money! Honestly find a different camera to buy, these don't work.\",\n",

It’s perfect size and the quality is amazing. I’m definitely thinking about getting me one for myself because it gets better picture quality than my own phone and it comes with a SD card so it’s easy to print out the pictures for any photo albums! I love this camera and so do my girls. Definitely worth the money.',\n",

The picture quality is awesome - it takes super clear videos (like the fancy ones!) and sharp photos that look professional. Plus, they threw in a 32GB memory card, so I can snap away without worrying about space. The zoom thing is cool too - makes everything closer! It\\'s easy to use, perfect for anyone. Seriously, for the price, this camera is a steal.\"',\n",

              "    'It has been an absolute delight. The camera is designed with children in mind - it’s durable, easy to hold, and the colorful design is very appealing. The picture quality is surprisingly good for a child’s camera, capturing clear and vibrant images that my kid loves to show off. Its user-friendly interface allowed my child to quickly learn how to take photos and review them on the built-in screen. The added features, like fun filters and simple editing tools, keep my child engaged and creative. What I appreciate most is the camera’s ability to withstand the rough and tumble play of kids; it’s already survived a few drops unscathed. The battery life is also impressive, lasting through several days of sporadic use. Overall, this camera is a fantastic tool for introducing children to photography, sparking creativity, and capturing memories from their perspective. Highly recommended for any parent looking to nurture their child’s creative side.”',\n",

This card does not work, and I could not find anything in the product description specifying what the camera needs. After reading through the reviews, we found out that this camera needs a 32gb A1 card. This was very frustrating to figure out. However, once we did camera works great and my daughter loves it.',\n",

              "    'Note: The simm card that’s is showing under frequently bought together, is not the correct simm card. Need to make sure it is a class 10 U1 32 GB. Also, I think the instructions could have been much better. Very basic without going into detail, I different photo styles, for instance, selfies, or zooming, etc. seems you have to figure it out by trial and error. Bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter…I probably would have spent a bit more money for better quality.'],\n",

              "    'It has been an absolute delight. The camera is designed with children in mind - it’s durable, easy to hold, and the colorful design is very appealing. The picture quality is surprisingly good for a child’s camera, capturing clear and vibrant images that my kid loves to show off. Its user-friendly interface allowed my child to quickly learn how to take photos and review them on the built-in screen. The added features, like fun filters and simple editing tools, keep my child engaged and creative. What I appreciate most is the camera’s ability to withstand the rough and tumble play of kids; it’s already survived a few drops unscathed. The battery life is also impressive, lasting through several days of sporadic use. Overall, this camera is a fantastic tool for introducing children to photography, sparking creativity, and capturing memories from their perspective. Highly recommended for any parent looking to nurture their child’s creative side.”',\n",

This card does not work, and I could not find anything in the product description specifying what the camera needs. After reading through the reviews, we found out that this camera needs a 32gb A1 card. This was very frustrating to figure out. However, once we did camera works great and my daughter loves it.',\n",

Also, I think the instructions could have been much better. Very basic without going into detail, I different photo styles, for instance, selfies, or zooming, etc. seems you have to figure it out by trial and error. Bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter…I probably would have spent a bit more money for better quality.'],\n",

I wasn't sure how good it was gonna because in the description it says kids camera, but I thought I would give it a try and see. So far, this seems to be a great camera for taking pictures or video. Easy to use, all buttons are easy to push and use. You can see the picture you take on the screen and if you don't like it, delete it. Comes with it's own memory card already in the camera. Also, comes with the cord for charging and plugging into your computer for transferring pictures to it. (One cord)  Has great clarity and takes beautiful pictures. Very surprised how well the pictures come out. Also, has automatic flash and you can turn flash on or off. Has zooming too. Haven't tried everything on it, just a few pics so far. But it was very easy to use and I am very satisfied with it.  Not many people use camera anymore, they just use their phones. I just wanted a camera because I prefer them over the phone camera. Works great and very satisfied with it.  Comes with a nice booklet with instructions on how to use everything and is very easy to read.  The price is great for this Camera. Easy for anyone to use. I feel it's a little more advanced for younger children but would be great for ages 12 yrs and up.  Highly Recommend It. Would make a wonderful gift too. Read more\",\n",
              "    \"This is a fully-functional digital camera, the same as you would've bought and used around the time the first few generations of Smartphones were introduced, albeit with a lower quality plastic housing, but with a few modern improvements such as a much higher capacity micro SD card, and a USB-C connecter.  This camera isn't going to compare with what any modern smartphone is capable of, but if you have or know of a kid that isn't ready for a smartphone yet, but they have an interest in taking pictures, this could honestly be great. The build quality of the camera isn't anything magical, and it doesn't have a touchscreen, but it does have all the options and auto-features that you'd want.  Kids should be able to pick up the basic functions of this camera very quickly, although there's a lot of more in-depth things that they'll likely need help with, such as transferring the pictures off the camera, which is done by connecting a USB from it to your computer, which mounts it as a removable device that you can transfer the pictures from (think USB flash drive).  Also worth mentioning, this camera has more granular controls available, if you or your child wants to explore them, such as as exposure time and ISO sensitivity, and I will also mention that the manual is a bit dated, as the computer requirements reference things like Windows XP/Vista/7, and a Macintosh G3, but it should be just fine.

              "    \"Reason i only have the pics of the box is that this was a present for my daughter and I had to wait to get her thoughts on it once she opened it before doing the review...  She is mid 30's so she isnt a kid at all but her son, my grandson, is rather severely autistic so he often commandeers things he likes even if they are hears which is the main reason i got this camera that was rated for kids as well.  i scored big time with this one. not only does my daughter enjoy using it and she says its perfect to just keep in her bag or in her glove box, but even with her son snatching it a time or two it delighted him that he was able to figure out how to use it and they both love the quality pictures it gives.  now granted its not a 5 grand dslr.... so take that into consideration when you get this. this is aw step ONE type camera not a professional photogs piece of equipment.  It frustrates me when I read about something not being top of the line perfection when the item CLEARLY states the level the item is and what to expect.  In my view there was NO deception in the description of what this is and does and the suggested expectations of its ability is spot on. Thank you to this company for its transparency.  i was not displeased and will gladly purchase from this brand in the future Read more\",\n",
