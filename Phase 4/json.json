It's super durable, very easy to use, and he feels so grown up that he can zoom, use the flash, and take photos and video. Highly recommend for kids who are interested in photos and want a durable first camera!", "While the display isn\u2019t the best, this little camera takes nice photos underwater, and in salt water. No issues with leaking and it held its charge really well. You can see the quality of your photos after you download them to a device that has a better display. And regular photos look great too. I did have a difficult time focusing on some objects underwater but that could be user error and some practice is needed.", "I bought this camera for use in an industrial work setting in a fairly harsh environment. Being waterproof, dustproof, and shockproof is pretty important in this role as even weather-sealed DSLRs and superzooms cannot withstand the conditions that this camera can take. In this role the camera works well, especially for the price.  The specifications for the camera are adequate for its use to take pictures, but don't expect the quality that you'd expect from a midrange prosumer DSLR or mirrorless camera. It has an effective 35mm focal length of 27 mm to 108 mm and a 4x optical zoom, but using it out to 4x is difficult without the use of a tripod. It has an aperture of f/3.0 to f/6.6, so it isn't optimal for low light conditions but works fine for outdoor use until twilight. It has 16 Megapixels, but this doesn't matter too much unless you're printing large images. It has a pretty small 1/2.3\" BSI CMOS sensor.  Pros:  Excellent weatherproofing: The particular use case for this camera allows it to operate in conditions that would otherwise destroy a camera. It is waterproof up to 15 m (49 ft), shockproof up to 2 m (6 ft), and dustproof IP6X. I use it an in extremely chemically dusty environment that quickly corrodes exposed contacts. This camera performs spectacularly in this environment due to its design. It doesn't have the left-right command zoom nor a rotating command button interface like in a lot of prosumer cameras, but this is a good thing for weatherproofing. If the camera gets dirty you can just rinse it off with water which is fantastic. Being completely enclosed without a separate lens means you don't need to worry about sensor contamination or cleaning the inside of lenses. The bottom cover is sealed with a rubber gasket to prevent water ingress into the battery compartment during use.  Sharp Lens: The focus on this camera is excellent and provides a very sharp focus, particularly in Macro mode. It can provide a large amount of detail provided that the focus is what you want it to be (which can be tricky). The Macro mode works well here and can focus on close range objects without too much difficulty other than the exact focal point due to the limitations of the LCD display resolution.  Intuitive Interface: There aren't a huge amount of bells and whistles in the UX/UI interface and this simplifies the overall operation. The command console is just the standard buttons (macro, delete, flash, display). The buttons are simple for zoom (out and in) and playback / recording. There is one button for shooting mode and one for the menu. Taking pictures uses the single button on the top right of the camera. There is a small drawback here in that the various modes (Auto / Program / Manual / Landscape etc.) are embedded within the UI and not in a separate command dial. It doesn't have a separate Aperture Priority / Shutter Priority that you'd find in prosumer cameras but the Manual mode does allow some more precise control than other point-and-shoots with EV compensation up to \u00b1 3 EV with 1/3 step increments. It also allows for white balance control. The camera has the standard options for time-delay pictures so you can be in the frame or if you're using a tripod to stabilize the camera.  Portable: This camera is fairly small and can easily fit in a shirt pocket. The included wrist strap makes it easy to keep on you to prevent it from accidentally dropping. I like that the wrist strap connection is metal and not plastic and seems sturdy. Images can be reviewed fairly easily on your phone using the  Non-Proprietary Codecs: Pictures are taken in the universal .jpg format and movies in .mov format. This allows it to be displayed on practically all devices without needing to convert it. It doesn't have RAW capability though so post-processing can be a bit limited.  Decent WiFi: Connecting to it with your phone is fairly straightforward once you have the PIXPRO Remote Viewer, and you can use it to take basic pictures (basically the shutter button) remotely and review images on your phone screen (which will likely be better than using the integral LCD).  Decent Battery Life: No complaints here, but not a lot to say either. During normal use it can give you a good 2 hours or so of frequent picture taking before needing a recharge. This is on par with other cameras of its class. Charging is done by opening the bottom cover and, while the battery is inside, connecting a mini USB-A connector (included).  Bright Flash: The forward-mounted integrated flash is pretty bright. You can't aim it in any way and there is no diffusion. It can help offset some of the low light performance but it can blow out the white balance some of the images if you're not careful.  Price: For what it can do, it is very competitively priced for its feature set and its weatherproofing capability. It doesn't have all of the advanced bells and whistles, nor the best specs, but for most people it should be \"good enough.\"  Cons:  Difficult Focusing: While the lens does focus sharply, it can be difficult to get it to focus exactly on what you want. Part of this problem is due to the small, poor resolution LCD display. Often you can't really tell if the picture is focused to your satisfaction until post when you can review it on your computer. There is also some lag on the display that is noticeable when moving or rotating the camera. It lacks an electronic viewfinder so you're completely reliant on the rear LCD display for composition and image review.  Poor Image Stabilization: The image stabilization isn't great and you need an incredibly steady hand when taking pictures in medium to low light conditions (such as indoors) otherwise you'll get some blurry images. This often means in practice having to retake images which can be frustrating.  Poor Low-Light Conditions: This is an issue that isn't unique to cameras with the small 1/2.3\" sensor size, but is particularly noticeable with the poor image stabilization. The auto and program features attempt to counter this by bumping up the ISO and manages to choose an appropriate speed to maintain a balanced exposure. The standard advice applies here: use a tripod when possible and a time-delay for low-light conditions.  Small LCD and Poor Resolution: The LCD (2.7 in with 230k pixels) is not super great for image review. It is fine for composing pictures if you can get past the movement lag. When taking pictures in Macro mode it can be difficult to review where the precise focus is located.  Limited microSD Capacity: This camera only accepts microSDHC cards up to 32 GB. This isn't a lot compared to what you can get these days in 2023, but provides ~7500 or so Fine quality images. The bottleneck will be the battery. However, 32 GB microSD cards are super cheap and you can carry a lot of them around.  Conclusion: This is a pretty good camera for use in harsh environments, but be aware that it isn't perfect in every situation. It should work well though for family vacation pictures where you don't want to constantly worry about getting sand everywhere since all it needs is a simple rinse to clean it.

The app to use with this is also the most useless thing ever. The app has no menu or features. Can't connect to Wi-Fi even though there is an option but good luck trying to figure out how to set it up. The Manuel is absolutely the most useless thing ever. It gives you instructions but they don't help in anyway. Nothing really on you tube. I honestly suggest saving up and buying a Cannon camera. I wish I never lost mine. Cannon is the hands down the best user friendly camera on the planet. This camera is not... I ended up taking pictures of the pictures I took from my phone and editing them that way. So inconvenient in every way. NO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. !!!! WASTE OF MONEY.", "Bought for someone interested in photography as a starter camera, and they loved it!", " I like how small and lightweight this camera is, and it does produce fairly good pictures and video, along with decent audio. Unfortunately I quickly realized that this camera is better suited for snorkeling than SCUBA. I took it on my most recent trip to Playa De Carmen, and used it on roughly 8 dives. Each time when I reached about 32'/10m depth the buttons no longer depress. Most of my dives averaged about 38', and so I had to squeeze with a mighty force to activate the camera. Even when I could get it to begin video, often the video would stop because the pressure caused the button to depress multiple times.  Long story short, if you snorkel or take pictures in the pool, this camera is great, but if infesting in something for SCUBA, this will be a pass. Which is sad because it's one of the more affordable underwater cameras. Read more", "I bought this as a backup camera for travelling, not wanting to spend the several hundred dollars more I spent on my primary camera. Initial tests seemed to produce fuzzy pictures and I emailed the company to ask. I got an extremely prompt and helpful reply. By going back to factory default settings and pressing the button slowly - halfway down, wait for teh click, wait for the focus rectangle to turn green, then finish pressing the button - I'm getting excellent pictures. There are a lot of settings available and I'm still learning to use them. It won't shoot clear pictures as fast as my much more expensive camera, but for the price I think it is an outstanding camera, and I think having a good help desk is a major plus.", "My son (12) took this on his first cruise. It's definitely waterproof, as he took videos going down the water slides, and drop proof, as he is a little clumsy.

The default setting when you turn it on is for the rear facing camera, which means we have hundreds of pics of half my kid's face.  The display doesn't show the pic you just took. You have to navigate from the camera to the menu to the gallery to see your shot, so there's no gratification for young photographers.  Responses to any buttons pressed are slow and glitchy.  The picture quality is bad (which is understandable, it's a kids camera).  The lanyard is adult sized, so the camera hangs to the knees of a small child.  The first camera we received didn't even work, so we were disappointed to find the replacement to be so frustrating for my 3 year old to use. This would definitely be easier for older children to navigate, maybe more like 6 and up instead of the 3 and up stated on the product page. I will say it is very sturdy.

You can tell most of the cameras follow the same control scheme, and look almost identical. However I tried this one out, since it looked somewhat different. It was actually worse. My 3 y/o loves playing with them, but it's getting old having to deal with them not working. Had to return this one as well because the unit simply wouldn't stay powered on after a day, even while plugged in. I noticed the picture quality was worse than the previous model, the shutter speed was insanely slow, and the selfiie mode is entirely out of his understanding on how to turn on. In case you were wondering - since it's not in the instructions at all - I figured out you have to press and hold the shutter button for a good 3 seconds to flip the camera around. The other model only took a single button press, and my kid loved to take pictures of himself making funny faces. He basically can't do that now because he doesn't understand to press and hold the button. Seriously, if you're gonna spend $20-30, skip this one and just take a chance at one of the more popular brands.  Edit: Dropped to 1*. Received a replacement until, and this one broke after two days.

The build quality is great with easy access to plug in. The gestures I feel like is picked up much easier than the tiny 2 and that is refreshing. Seeing a company to go up and beyond the standards, as well as expanding the boundaries of streaming/content creation has me excited and hopeful for the future!  Pros: -Bigger Display -Picture Quality -Remote Use -Good Mic -Enhanced AI -4k 30FPS Read more", "I've been playing with this slick little camera for several days now, and it's close to perfection. I'll start with the negatives. Learning curve. The app is well designed, but the layout does not match the online manual. Many basic features are buried three levels deep, while others are duplicated. Face tracking is easily confused the closer you are to the camera. For example, about 18 inches away from me provides a surprisingly good wide-angle. But if I stand up quickly from my chair, the gimbal starts to hunt. If I use a hand gesture and the gesture is not recognized, the camera often starts tracking my hand. So you really need the app or software running so you can catch stuff like this.  Hand gestures work about 75% of the time. They can't be sloppy, and I have not been able to get a couple to work at all.  Almost everything can be set, from going full auto to manual on the settings, tracking speed, three memorized positions and more. Cropping, zooming, tracking target. All can be set. For some reason the camera defaults to animal instead of human when recording me - maybe because I have a full beard? But if I use the app I can change it. It's also worth noting that the camera can't spin a full 360 degrees. There's a hard stop - so it would go 359 degrees, then have to travel back to the start to continue. So plan your shots with that in mind.  The video records 4K at an average of 98 mbps, so you have excellent quality when recording. Resolution can be set to 4K 30fps or 1080P at 60fps. This requires a class U3 micro-SD card.  The camera has a micro-HDMI port for video output, USB-C for computer or accessories. For example, there's a USB-C to Ethernet adapter. There's also an external mic input.  The computer software is easy to use and can work stand-alone or with your video / streaming software. I used the app on my phone forst to connect the camera to our network. Then I ran the PC software. When I tried to connect it told me to turn on my computer's bluetooth. My PC does not have bluetooth. I hit \"Esc\" thinking that was it - I needed bluetooth. Nope - the software found the camera on the network, but there was never an indication that was an option.  It also runs hot. I had the camera sitting on a book - the base hit about 108 degrees fahrenheit. So you want it on a surface that does not trap heat, or on a tripod/stand. When cameras run hot the battery life usually suffers.  Included is a custom fit carry case, two USB adapters and a USB-C cable. The packing is all cardboard, no tons of plastic waste. I wish it had a lens cap, but I can 3D print one. I'd rate it 90 out of 100, and all my complaints are in the software or APP department, and I had to create an account online. Read more", "This tracking camera allows you a way to stream or record with a head that pans and tilts to follow your movements. It's advertised as being A.I., which refers to a plethora of intuitive feature sets that responds to human gestures instead of pressing a bunch of buttons or dials. This is the way cameras are going these days. Instead of constantly repositioning angles with DSLRs or mirrorless cameras, A.I. will automate them for a more fluid look and feel in the footage. There are virtually too many features to list, making it over engineered, and imperative for you to research more for your own specific use cases.  This is a cute gizmo to have with a steep price point. The gesture control takes some getting used to, especially making the shape of an L, which is not too complimentary--at least in the U.S. There is no screen, because your phone or an external monitor becomes the screen.  The picture comes out sharp, but better for closer up action with good lighting as opposed to seminars. I'd also think it's best to keep this camera on a flat surface. I'm not saying you'd roll it down a hill, but I think it would work best as a stationary computer camera not a vlogging camera. The audio is okay but a little tinny, but you can attach an external mic to refine it.  My only concern is that I have not had a camera like this before, so there's no basis for comparison. As a corollary to this, I don't know if this device will quickly move to obsolescence when the next advances in A.I. tracking innovation.

Worth the extra to buy the Tail Air and enjoy all the quality built in features this little beauty can produce !", "This \"OBSBOT Tail Air Streaming Camera\" almost looks like something out of a Sci-Fi movie (like Passengers for example). It looks great and looks very high-tech, and hopefully that AI element is more Johnny-Five-like and less Terminator-like.  The camera has some amazing features and capabilities to really help it deliver and perform, it is far from just being a 4K webcam! There are great connectivity options, from wireless and USB, to being able to go live \"in a snap.\" It has pan and tilt which you can set through the software, great tracking (especially of people...or \"human tracking\" as it calls it.) The 4K quality speaks for itself, but you also get f/1.8 aperture and a decent size sensor which preforms well in low light and difficult lighting conditions. I won't rant about what it offers as I'd be here all day (and the product page writes it better than I could).  Overall, I've been really impressed in so many ways already. I love the ability to track the hand gestures and the focusing it brings. It's not completely perfect but very close to it. Plus it was a nice surprise to find out that it has a build in battery. That really increases the portability and makes it a lot more versatile. The AI for the tracking does work well, providing the scene isn't overly complex or busy. I expect there might be a software update and some point to tweak things a bit. But so far, it has really delivered and preformed well in each and every way I've tried.  It is expensive, but you get a lot of bang for your buck and the end result speaks for itself. If you need a high-end and very capable streaming camera, then I think you've found it...

Prices are not bad for storage on the app either.", "First off, I'm a Director of IT for a healthcare company, we have 17 sites in three cities all networked together flawlessly, and have worked in the It field for 25+ years, so this review is coming from a plethora of experience. This camera is poorly designed, I expected cheap (it was purchased to watch a dog), but the software, and camera design is inexcusable. First, the design flaw, the \"reset\" button is useless, it is under the camera \"orb\", between the bottom of the orb and the rotational housing/case. If you do not have 100% control over the camera, it cannot be reset, ever as it is \"at rest\" underneath the camera with a few mm space between the camera and the housing. Yet, in the set up instructions they say \" if you have trouble, reset the camera and try again\", which is impossible to do. The second thing is, The app you use to connect to the camera allows you to connect to the camera, but then uses some mystical \"audio transfer\" of your wireless configuration to the camera to complete the network set up. Rather than letting you enter your SSID/network name, and the password, your completely at the mercy of a poorly written API to work with a tone deaf camera. I've never heard of such nonsense in my life, and I've set up and manage a million dollar network for a living. If the API can communicate with the camera, there is no reason to not allow you to configure the camera for your wireless network, but there it is, you cant. Finally the app provided is faulty, it provides a wireless signal tester that's crap and downplays your wireless strength. Like I said I work in IT, I have many nifty apps on my phone for my job, including multiple paid apps to evaluate wireless signals, signal strength , channels etc, My wireless dual band router is 15' line of sight away from the mounting area, with nothing but open air between the two devices and the app claimed the network signal was horrible, while every other app I have has me at full bars, no Db loss and excellent transfer on both Bands. They've loaded the app to put the fault of poor performance on the consumer. be warned.... do not buy Read more", "Great picture quality and zoom quality is good especially for the price.

I was planning on making an upgrade, but not for $25/mo per set up. I spent considerable time reviewing other options and decided these cameras may be a good replacement. So far I am happy with my purchase - so happy I replaced another one of my other Arlo systems with the same package. Some pros and cons:  Pros - simple to set up. Up, mounted and running in less than an hour - solar works great to keep them charged, even thru a window - Mounted my second system in the afternoon and the solar panels easily recharged the brand new out of box cameras at 75% to 100% in a few afternoon hours. - while I miss my cloud service, the internet accessible phone system works really well, as good if not better than Arlo. - I like the wide screen view, allows me to pick up more space - I also like the ability to dial in the detection zone with no extra fees - One concern I had was distance from the home base. My shop building is 110 feet from my two story house and no issues with the distance. Probably close to the max distance - Cameras are clear, better than my Arlo system. - Cameras work in zero to subzero weather unlike Arlo.  Cons - wish there was a PC based way to access the cameras - cameras are a little bigger than Arlo and not quite as compact - miss the magnetic mounts of Arlo, those were nice to mount and adjust - but not a deal killer - would be nice to be able to better adjust the cord length. Nice to have the cord length in some cases, more problematic when the camera and solar are close together. - simplify the various settings. A bit more complicated to make adjustments.  Good system, I like it obviously because I bought a second system. I'll update this review if I have more pros or cons. Sorry Arlo, make better business decisions next time.

I previously had Arlo cameras for over 2 years, but got tired of changing the batteries and paying for the required monthly service to view footage. These AOSU cameras were very easy and quick to install. The day and night images are excellent and the security videos are instantly stored in the included storage device that plugs into router. These cameras always show 100% charge with the plug in included solar panels, and there's no need to replace batteries. The cameras also have sound and microphones, and the system includes a loud alarm siren if needed. The zoom is awesome on my cell phone, and can also watch or record live video anytime.

I wish I hadn't waisted so much money and fees on the Arlo system.", "Easy to install! It works great in HD view! Sometimes the solar panels do not want to work, but the battery is durable, so it is not like you need them all the time. Personally, I think the cameras are great.", "The product setup is about as plug and play as you could ask for, set up the base, turn on the cameras, no technical challenges.  It took me about 2-2 1/2 hour after the cameras charged to install the system, and most of this was deciding placement.  If you want to save your data, there is an additional $269.99 for a 5 device cloud storage service, but for me it seems worthwhile unless you know your home base cannot be stolen\u2026  The price structure goes from 3 devices annually to 5 devices, even though the system is limited to 4, a bit of company pricing magic I guess.  The app is easy to use and has quite a suite of options, the video quality is very good, and the night vision is awesome!  I\u2019m on my first day/night and very happy so far, more to come as time and trial goes by!

That being said my intended use was amusement for my wife and it has been fantastic. Picture quality is good day or night , the viewing angle is great and Im pleasantly surprised at the wifi range. Our wireless system is very fast but the range has been anemic. I was anticipating upgrading to a mesh router system eventually and I was pretty sure that would be sooner than later. I never thought the camera on the garage behind our house and the one on our front porch would be in range. Not a problem at all. I have only set up those 2 cameras outside so far. After the initial usb charging I left the other 2 on my work bench with the solar panels attached. Amazingly the over head light at my work bench has kept them charged up. She loves feeding the outside cats that come to our backdoor. I was using a trail cam so she could watch but it meant moving it all the time and removing the sd card daily to see what is on it. With this system not only can my wife enjoy watching the cats (all of which she has named) but the occasional skunks and possums that show up and eat right along side the cats. It has been cheap entertainment for the boss. Catching potential porch pirates is an added bonus from my point of view. The set up was really simple. We still have a wireless camera bird feeder in the box that my daughter gave my wife 3 years ago. Periodically I get it out and try to do the setup and fail each time. No problem with this system! I'm going to set up one of the remaining cameras for bird watching. Our area is pretty rural . Anyone who lived in the country in our area would undoubtedly be able to watch all kinds of deer bear, coyotes etc. Durability is very important to me so if these stand the test of time I will edit this and give them a 5 across the board.

I am very happy with the support and the system. solar has been effective to charge. I am also very impressed with the app. the settings, UI, etc. are intuitive. 100% satisfied. Night vision could be better. But for its price, So far so good !!!!", "Very easy to set up to get it going and happy with the product. My house is on a 60\u2019 x 200\u2019 lot. I placed the cameras underneath the roof soffit about 10 feet off the ground at the four corners of my house and locate the home base unit next to the Wi-Fi router in my study room on the 2nd floor about the mid-point between all the cameras. All my cameras are located at least about 75-100 feet from the home base unit and they are all able to achieve no less than 4 out of 5 bars for the signal strength. The color live and recorded videos are very sharp and clear during the day and also at night, even when it is very dark and under poor lighting conditions. The cameras also have a feature to turn on the infra read lights automatically. However, the videos will become black and white but still remain crisp and sharp. The solar panels that come with the camera can provide sufficient charge to the cameras with just average 1-2 hours of strong sun light per day. If I disconnect the solar panel power cable from the camera, with a 100% battery charge the camera would still run for about 3-4 weeks with a few recording clips made every night before the power being depleted down to about \u00bc. The cameras also work well day and night even when the temperature sometimes dipped below -20C during the winter. I live in Canada.  The Aosu app provides many features and flexibility, including the motion detection set up. The cameras detect movements up to about 20-30 feet away, even at night and in the rain, when the detection sensitivity is set at maximum. I notice there is virtually little difference with the detection range between day and night. However, after detecting a movement, the cameras would take about a few seconds to start the recording so very often the recordings would not capture the first few moments of the movement.  I am very satisfied with the Aosu cameras and I bought 3 more extra Aosu 2K cameras for placing them on the fence adding on to the existing system with a total of 7 cameras and they are all being managed by the same the Aosu app on my cell phone with no problem. Unfortunately, since the home base unit can only accommodate the recordings of 4 cameras, the recording storage for the 2 additional cameras have to done through micro SD cards inside the cameras and the 3rd extra camera that I bought contains its internal memory storage so I didn\u2019t have to purchase any micro SD cards. I however notice not all the Aosu 2K cameras offer the same viewing angle width. The cameras that require micro SD cards do not capture the same width compare to the 4 cameras that comes with the home base package. Read more", "I recently purchased the AOSU 2K Security Cameras for my home, and I couldn't be more satisfied with the level of security and peace of mind they provide. The standout feature for me is the battery-operated design. No need for complex wiring or worrying about power outages. This camera works flawlessly on battery power, and it's incredibly convenient to install anywhere around my property. The PIR Human Motion Detection is incredibly accurate. It ensures that I receive alerts only when there's actual movement, reducing false alarms. The full-color night vision is a game-changer. It provides crystal-clear footage even in low light conditions, and the built-in spotlight adds an extra layer of security. The two-way audio feature allows me to communicate with visitors or potential intruders from anywhere, adding a personal touch to my home security. And in case of suspicious activity, the built-in siren can be activated, deterring potential threats. The installation was straightforward, and the mobile app is user-friendly. I can easily monitor my property remotely and receive instant alerts if something triggers the motion detection. In summary, the AOSU 2K Security Cameras have elevated my home security to a whole new level. They're reliable, packed with features, and offer the peace of mind I've been looking for.

La 2K p seria solo si la carama esta muy alta por ejemplo, en modo fluido se supone avisa m\u00e1s rapido pero no note mucha diferencia mabos son rapidos. La detecion de movimiento (sin suscripcion de nube) es ajustable por ejemplo solo Humanos para que no pite los gatos, tbien se puede ajustar su sensibilidad un peque\u00f1o esquema explica bien cual debes elegi o bien autoajuste. La xamara graba siempre los enventos pero solo envia notificacion al movil cuando tu quieres puede elgir franjas horarias, con un modo inmediatoas rapido pero detecta pero la diferencia entre humano y gato, y modo inteligente mejor pero un poco m\u00e1s lento (ambos son rapidos no hay mucha diferencia).

Se invece si tratta di una persona conosciuta potrete semplicemente parlare con lei come se la telecamera fosse un normale video citofono.  \u00c8 anche possibile registrare il video come in una telecamera a circuito chiuso gratuitamente su microSD e su cloud in prova gratuita per 7 giorni.

I dont know if this was a \"growing pains\" situation gor the app/software, or if this was a genuine issue that worked itself out somehow. But either way I have not had any deal breaker type of issues with this camera in many months now, and it has been recording away 24/7 in the position I set it to point now for a while. Definitely a good purchase for the $20-ish price range compared to others I the same range. Updating my original review below from 2 stars to 4 stars at this point... not 5, only because there are still things the hardware is more than capable of doing that are not available due to the software or cannot be used unless you pay blurams additional money for their cloud services that no one really needs, as long as you own an sd card, and that shouldn't be aloud to be a thing... unfortunately though, all cameras in this price range have this same exact featureless software to control it without paying the company's extra for cloud recording. They've pretty much all adopted this type of business model now, so I can't knock blurams in particular more than just 1 star for that alone. Deffinately didn't expect this camera to last recording to SD on 24/7 loop like it had been for longer than a few momths. Overall it's a smart device that I havent toyed around with or had to opem the app for any reason at all in momths now, which is what your aiming for with any smart device. Pleasantly surprised with this little burams camera hardware. Not at all impressed with the software, but also not wntirely dissapointed either. More control and capabilitiesthan most others, IF you pay the $2/momthly subscription. Whis is extremely reasonably priced by the way, but It's not the cost i take issue with, its the deceptive sales model that seemingly all sub $100 camera brands have all adopted at this point.*  The camera will not re-center itself after motion detection, and gets stuck looking at a blank wall. Only way yo fix this is to stop recording to SD and use cloud uploads only for it to function properly is what I've learned after being on my 3rd replacement device now. If you turn off the motion tracking feature and just leave it in one position though it seems to work just fine with SD recording, BUT.... the push notifications for qhen it fetes a person, motion, ect. Are instant when only recording to the cloud, and are delayed by a full minute at least when you have \"playback from SD\" selected in the settings.  Yo sum it up the hardware is great and works great without an SD card in it, but given its features and 90% of people buy this for that exact selling point of having an SD card slot and not having to rely on a cloud service - The firmware for these blurams cameras needs to be updated BADLY because I really do like the device but it's seemingly being overloaded by recording HQ TO the SD card at the same time that it is uploading to the cloud and it just overloads it to the point where the auto tracking feature and re-entering functions of the actual hardware get canceled out like ctrl+alt+del on a computer because it just dosent have the available resources to handle all of this at once... ice came home everyday the past week now yo my camera being on with the night vision on, but the actually lens pointed all the way up into the off position and who knows how long it was this way for? So clearly that not acceptable and this issue needs to be fixed. If it ever get a firmware update to allow the primary record and playback from to be the SD card and make the cloud uploads a secondary backup that the camera uploads when it is proccessing nothing else, that's all it would take to make this a perfect camera and I would change my review to 5 stars... but as it currently sits, this I not an auto motion tracking camera if you plan to use an SD card and I almost feel like they know this and have the firmware designed this way purposely to sell their (fairly priced & good) cloud services, which I absolutely refuse and purposely bought this camera because of the SD card slot. I do not want my entire 2.4ghz band of my network being maxed out around the clock because of a little security camera, which is exactly what happens anytime it records an event unless you turn the cloud recording off....and once you turn it off from what I read in the app. Rhee is no way to reactivate your remaining trial time and you just lose it so \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f FIX YOUR PURPOSELY BROKEN FIRMWARE BLURAMS.

The feed cuts out too often, the visual is sometimes / often black and requires numerous app closures and re-starts.... can ou imagine if you are recording and you see somebod stealing your stuff and the feed constantly cuts out / resets? The devioce often disconnected and kept resetting....  I replaced it with the Decko equivalent model. Sad because IMo the Blu rams unti actually looks etter, rotates better etc... but the decko unit WORKS.  This is not the end though... I will keep the BR unit since i own it and will just keep it to see how it continues to degrade... or improve??? with time.  The Decko unit is not without flaws.... but it works so much better. The night vision is better, the feed and controls work as well...i think the BR has better controls.. .but they do not / hardly work.  2/14/23  Still updating / getting whatever money I can out of these junks.  Currently getting a lot of \"oops device has disconnected\" messages when devices are literally right next to the wifi routers. and viewing device has excellent recption etc...  The camera seems to restart randomly.. It loses connection and literally performs the self test in the middle of viewing.  Using it to watch some baby animals and it freezes, picture cuts to black / app needs restarting and the camera movement crashes the whole app.  it just gets \"better\" as time goes by... better meaning worse!!!!!!!  update:  oct2022: At this point im just keeping it to update for other people...why not? The connwection is still bad and controls are mediocre at best.... the decko isnt outstanding but has more control over this unit.  It still has problem loading a picture... yet the ads load flawlessly. I wanted to check on m birds.. but couldnt as the little \"spinning circle\" just kept spinning.  Voice / sound is poor... why even have it as an option?  Sionce getting the deckop units several monts ago, this unit has failed and needed to be readded to the ap pseveral times... 3 times n a few months. The decko units thus far havent had an issue like that.  For the price, this camera is good. It has a lot of features for $25...even if it cost more the amount of features would be impressive....The night vision, I'd say is excellent, I've tested the two side by side literally and the alerts are faster and instantaneous compared to Dekco brand cameras, and there a few features that IMO make Bluerams great.. .but really, that's all there is to say. the app is filled with non stop ads to subscribe to cloud services, you can only watch maybe 15 seconds of live video, the reaction to controls is incredibly slow and inaccurate, it takes forever to load visuals.... and it freezes etc.. as I type this i can see the little \"loading\" circle going and going.. . When you get a notice that someone is potentially stealing your crap, you don;t want ot watch a 10?? second ad before you can view your cameras... Im not paying for cloud services yes, but I want to be able to see instantaneous feed... especially if I get a notice saying someone has appeared in my garage.... I understand they want to promote it but almost every time I check my camera or get a notice?  Overall I am quite disappointed. I have since started switching over to Dekco brand camers. Although those are also far from flawless. Id say they at least perform better and more reliably. One big advantage the Bluerams has over the dekco is that you can use the app to switch what wifi the unit is using. thats good if you have several different networks to choose from. Overall though, that one big advantage does not make it the superior unit.... very disappointed with these units. I have 3 of them and all 3 are the same. I also have the outdoor unit which was also disappointing. So far, for a similar price, the Decko units have performed well, have similar featuers, and have recently added more features that make it beeter than these... If you want my advice, get the Dekco units.  Updat: 8/31/22 Looks like the units have stopped working and have all \"disconnected\" It looks liek I will need to manually add the cameras again.... The reason why I am keeping these two onboard as compared to just repalceing them with Decko units is 1. I paid for them 2. they are in areas that aren;t that important.  So far the Deckos have been trouble free and they even updated the app which includes a manual light override, and a better 2 way ommunication option.  The ad advertising seems to have gotten more annoying / often as they try to advertise to you to buy cloud space. Read more", "I love this when I am not home to watch over my cat!

So I had to reconnected it\u2026 again, it took another 7 or 8 tries, only to have it disconnect AGAIN a few hours later!!! For no reason!!! I thought maybe I was doing something wrong, so I got my boyfriend to come over to help set it up, and it ALSO took him a few tries before it would connect. So I thought, \u201cHA! This should be ok now!\u201d\u2026 But guess what?? After a few hours, it disconnected AGAIN for no reason!!! Now, I\u2019m REALLY PISSED OFF! So I got my boyfriend to come over to set it up for me again, and guess what? This time, it wouldn\u2019t connect to my wifi network at all!!! After about 15 tries, we finally gave up. This camera is an absolute piece of crap, and the only place it belongs is in the garbage. I will never buy another Blurams again, nor do I recommend any of their products. Totally useless piece of junk!  EDIT: Seller is extremely nice! He contacted me and apologized for the defective security camera I received, and offered to send me another one free of charge!!! My boyfriend helped me install the new security camera, and so far (it\u2019s been a week), it seems to work ok. So I\u2019m changing the one-star rating to a four-star. I really appreciate and loved the fact that the seller is willing to stand behind his products\u2026 And is willing to make amends if something goes wrong! Because of this, I would buy from this seller again! Read more", "I did consider purchasing a more expensive camera going by the rule 'you get what you pay for'. However, given the reviews outside of Amazon online (I don't always trust Amazon reviews these days) I thought I would give it a go. I have to say so far, after 2 weeks, I have been pleasantly surprised. The camera has been excellent. I use it to keep an eye on my puppy when I am out of the house. The night and day vision is hard to fault and every time there is significant movement or sound I am notified immediately. The delay from reality to viewing on your phone is hardly noticeable, I'd say about half a second. Likewise, the audio from the camera to phone and visa-versa is the same slight delay, but always in sync with the display. Already, it has proven its worth. I was checking in on my dog and noticed it was out of its pen. I scrolled the camera around and saw it eating the plants. I came home immediately before it could do any more damage. On another occasion, I checked in on the camera and noticed the dog attempting to get out. I used the talk through option (very simple to use, just select 'talk') and told him to stop, he heard my voice and thankfully obeyed (I think he thought he wasn't being watched). I have also used the camera to effectively guide my children through a problem while I was out, again using the talk through option. Of course, all this requires good wifi for the camera and good signal from your phone.  When buying a camera like this, it's actually not that easy knowing where to start given there are so many at so many price points. In my opinion, it would be hard to get better value for money. It deserves a solid 4/5. Perhaps I am being a little harsh here, but for me what stops it from being a 5/5 is the fact that:  1. The initial advert when you log on to the app (it can be skipped after 3 second) 2. The Micro USB. (We all know the USB C provides a more solid connection that can take a few knocks) 3. The camera travels in the opposite direction when screen scrolling with your finger. (However, navigation through the app's circular pad option is better and works well and achieves 360 viewing).  Otherwise, the camera and integrated app is effective, functional and usable. Providing it keeps going for a few years, it's worth every penny at \u00a325. If I need another camera, I would buy this camera again without hesitation as points 1-3 aren't a deal breaker for me. Read more", "For the most part the camera has very good resolution and tracking works great too. However, I had an issue with my camera microphone staying on even after turning it off through settings. Contacted customer service back and forth with multiple emails for OVER 3 weeks. In the end they didn\u2019t even solve it for me and I ended up having to fix it by myself by just factory resetting the camera (lost all settings and shared invites). Customer service asked me what I did in return for free membership for 2 or 3 months. I gave that to them and they didn\u2019t even bother giving me the free membership mentioned, basically just ghosted me. Long story short, it\u2019s a great camera until you have to reach out to their abysmal support. Update Dec 26,2023: Well they emailed me offering me a refund and all I had to do was respond to their email. I did that and it\u2019s been over a week and their support still hasn\u2019t emailed back or even sent me the refund they promised. Definitely stay away from this brand if you think you\u2019ll need to use their tech support or if you\u2019ll need to contact customer service. Such a disappointment. Final update January 9, 2024: I eventually managed to get the free cloud service they mentioned and it turns out there was another option within the app in order to get it to work. However, as for getting my refund that hasn't even happened. I already gave them my order information and they keep claiming that they are \"checking on it\" but at the same time it's been another week and the refund is still no where to be seen on my credit card transactions. On top of that they still keep asking me to change my review even though nothing has been resolved for me through them. At this point I don't even expect them to give me my refund and additionally I ended up having to factory reset my camera a SECOND time even with their \"update\" due to the fact that the camera microphone issue came back a second time.

I wanted to set something up to monitor my driveway and entryway. Some of the things I was looking for were:  Local storage without a subscription. The camera can take a 256GB micro SD card and holds recordings for days and days. I have been using for a week and it's not even half full. You can go back to specific days and check the events by watching or downloading. Once the card is full it overwrites. What's nice is, because of the smart detection. I can filter out videos based on if it's a motion, vehicle, person, or animal event.  Constant power. I didn't want battery. This comes with its own power supply and a long extension cord. The extension cord is about 14 feet long with a few extra feet of cord on the power supply.  Wifi and Network capability. The Wifi connection is good. Able to connect on a 2.4ghz or 5ghz band. It also has an ethernet adapter. Also has the ability to connect with Alexa via a skills app. The Reolink app for alexa works great. I can ask Alexa to show me the camera on my Echo Show or Fire Tablet and it pulls it up with no problem  Setup was really simple. I connected it to my network via ethernet for the initial setup. Installed the app on my phone and went through the process. One thing I will stress. **UPDATE THE FIRMWARE** Not the app update. Go to the website and follow the instructions on how to download the latest firmware and how to update it. This solved some initial issues that I was having.  The Reolink phone app is great. Lots of different options to fiddle with. For example. Being able to setup non-detection zones (in my case blocking out the road so passing traffic doesn't trigger a recording), Night vision, motion tracking, color/black and white options, smart detection.... These are things that are fun to mess around with and decide what is right for you. Overall the app is very easy to use.  There are other things as well. Setting up a PC client, Accessing from a browser, using an FTP server, Remote monitoring, and the use of an NVR system.  And... the picture quality is great. Overall I am extremely happy with this purchase. Read more", "I originally bought one of these to put at my gate. It works so well and I love the auto tracking feature.

Installation is done in a matter of minutes.", "I've been using three E1 Outdoor cameras for a year now. Here's my take on their strengths and weaknesses. Pros: - High-quality video and audio. - Multiple access options, including the embedded browser, mobile app, desktop app, and RTSP. - Very configurable, including options for display, audio, detection sensitivity, notifications, FTP, and users. - Affordable. - Exceptional customer support. The team is professional, responsive, and has resolved all my queries and complaints within a 24 hours.  Cons: - The camera tends to drift from its guard point after tracking an object, making the auto-tracking feature virtually unusable. This is a known issue, as even customer support acknowledges that it occurs across all their PAN cameras. - Lack of firmware updates. There are at least two hardware versions of the E1 Outdoor, IPC_523SD8 and IPC_566SD85MP. However, only the IPC_566SD85MP is being updated on Reolink's download center. Read more", "These cameras work as indoor and outdoor. I now have three of them and am slowly building a surveillance system around my home. Most surveillance systems, while already costing $500 and up, require either a monthly subscription and/or a DVR to save video. With this camera, you can buy one at a time. The camera has a hidden area to add a 256GB micro-SD card. You can access via smart phone or PC application to monitor your cameras. It sets up very easy and quickly. You will need a power source nearby for each camera. In my opinion, this is a better way to set up a surveillance system across your home/business without forking out a large amount of money at once. As mentioned I am buying one at a time and now have three. Total video storage at the moment is roughly 750GB total, One more camera and I will have the same storage as most packages with DVR and for less overall. It has plenty of features such as Pan/Tilt/Zoom aka PTZ, vehicle, human, and animal recognition, motion detection, night vision, 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz wifi compatible, flood light and alarm. This camera offers 3X optical zoom and 5mp (2560x1920p) HD video which is important. Do not sacrifice the resolution. Go at least 5mp or higher. The higher the better. You may need it one day to get a license plate number or a clear facial image. I give five stars for this camera and highly recommend.", "Good picture quality, the spotlights that activate when set off work really well as does the siren although it is not very loud (just be careful on the sensitivity settings as it will go off in the night far more than you want if not careful. The main drawback is the pan and tilt. it works great and tracks well but after it tracks motion a few times, it loses it's monitoring point and stays stuck facing to the extreme right (or left) and won't return to the monitoring point, at which time you need to go into the app and reset the monitoring point again. This happens very regularly. Not sure if it is a firmware issue or a mechanical issue.  EDIT: Reolink customer service was fantastic and responded quickly to the issue, sent me a new camera that is working very well with no issues and refunded me the shipping cost to send the old camera back.

We now have 13 of them installed in different areas on our property. Their iPhone software is excellent as well. However, when it comes to their Windows software, an application that should allow constant monitoring of one or more cameras, the software is abominable.  Older versions (8.2) will run trouble free one day and lock up every few minutes another. It is extremely frustrating. All the newer versions, without exception, are even worse. The last one we tried, version 8.10.4 is, somehow, the worse to date. It doesn't seem to pick-up the cameras that the previous version was connected to, nor is it able to recognize cameras that offer right-left and up-down capabilities.  Just to be clear, whether the computer is running Windows 10, or another totally different and newer computer is running Windows 11, the result is the same. Reolink's software locks up randomly; not great if the person monitoring the video feed fails to notice that the displayed time from the cameras stopped some time ago.  While I can understand, and excuse teething pains in a new company, this Windows software situation, considering that Microsoft has the biggest share of the Operating System market, is ridiculous.  Reolink, it's time to step up your game.  Revised on November 30 2023.  I recently installed Reolink's newest software for Windows. What a change!

I don't even need to use my other extra router nearby. In fact, it's a pretty simple fix: I slide my internet modem/router only three feet away from its previous spot facing closer toward my Security Camera direction, and now it receives a constant 83% to 86% signal strength day & night. It's about 40-42 feet straight-line distance from my modem/router to the camera, with three drywalls through in between my Livingroom to the garage driveway where the camera is currently installed. I'm pretty much happy that my WiFi connection to the camera is solid stable in these last few days. To get to this, I keep staging my modem & router around until I have the best signal strength I want, and I stop it to its current best % signal strength spot. I can tell that staging my modem/router to the higher ground does not necessarily make it to produce a stronger signal, and in my case I place them on a small 27-inch tall table. Perfect!  *My Initial Review comment: I own other Security Cameras before, so as a comparison, I can say this ieGeek ZS-GX2S Solar Security Camera has a great HD view quality for the price. I'd say I won't be able to read car license plate numbers from a distance, but it'll display decently my street view with cars passing by up to 3-4 houses away during clear days. I put it on top of my garage driveway area, picking up any Live Motions (on Low set range) within my front yard area without annoying frequent alerts of bugs fluttering around nearby (at night on live mode I can see flying insects flashing by but no/never recording of it in my 128 GB Micro SD Card installed inside the camera). The speaker sound, which I adjust to 100% top volume, is just so-so given its small housing of the camera.  I can see with clarity on my recording during the day and acceptable good shots at night time. And that fulfills my purpose of installing this solar camera: to catch who is coming to my garage/front-door area (such as a mail carrier or visiting friend), with easier simple installation of solar panel compared to dragging power supply cable to the electricity wall-plug (almost impossible for this power cable to going through my garage rolling door, or too much work to drill a cable hole through garage sidewall). So far, this solar panel has been supplying a 100% Battery Power with no problems day & night (we live in mid Texas with plenty sunshine this early Spring).  Overall (for its price wise, functional performance and ease of installation), this ieGeek Solar Security Camera should easily gets my 5-star review rating if not for its shaky on & off WiFi connections at times. It only receives 70% to 75% internet signal strength from the main modem/router, and to be stable it needs above 80% WiFi signal strength. Right now I'm experimenting with putting an extra router (more) closer to the camera than my main modem/router, and I'll test if it helps to pickup a greater signal. Everything else is decent, installation is quick, except that its screw to hold the camera doesn't tight very well in place causing some slacks if touched. I only installed this camera in almost three weeks now, so I'll see if it holds up on its longer operation. For now I give it a 4-star review rating.

There are numerous positives: good resolution and auto-exposure for both night vision and daylight/color vision. Audio speaker and microphone sensitive and clear. This is a vastly different type of camera setup than the other ieGeek camera that is plug-in type. This battery camera is much more mobile obviously and the battery power is great and quickly charges with solar panel. The main difference is that this camera only records video when manually recording or motion detected whereas for plug-in model it can record continuously. Also this has PIR motion detection in overall area vs. other type camera has motion detection at specific areas you define if you like. There are fewer false motion alarms from things like rain mist at night. Since the camera must wake-up when motion is detected, there can be about a two second delay especially in night vision mode. Just be aware of the type of camera system you desire for motion detection and recording capabilities. The WiFi signal is strong even with camera outside on opposite side of house approx. 100 feet away from router that is inside. The LEDs are only four vs. ring type and are plenty sufficient to light up area and can be turned off so that when night vision mode is off, the camera can be used behind window to view outside even at night if there is sufficient light outside. In dark, LEDs do turn on momentarily with relay clicking noise if motion is detected even if night vision is turned off. I would want LEDs to remain off is night vision is turned off. The camera requires connection to internet for motion detection to engage. I use an SD card to record video, so I would want motion detection video to still be recorded even if internet connection is not available. It has worked fine in temperatures in the teens and also with a little rain. Customer support is excellent and build quality is great so far as I've used camera a few weeks.

Cheap and just work. I watched these cameras for a long time before trying a couple. I\u2019m glad I did. I got them on a good sale, around 42$ each. My buddy who is a professional security camera installer is blown away at their picture for a camera at 1/4 of his pro cam cost. Picture quality: The night vision is incredible. That\u2019s usually where the picture quality lacks. Picture is crisp and clean when night vision is on. What is even more impressive is the cameras ability to use what light it can pickup at night and keep color and clarity. I have a streetlight that is in my neighbors yard and I don\u2019t use night vision on 2 of my cameras because it can use the available light very well. I will say, I run these on 1080 as I don\u2019t see any real difference at 2k. But just remember, it depends on the screen you\u2019re viewing it on. For me, 1080 is plenty.  Spot light: It\u2019s pretty good. Not \u201cimpressive\u201d but impressive for something that is running on 5V USB.  Siren: Yup, it makes noise. You can even set it to initiate all sirens on your network at once.  Siren and Alert settings. YES you can turn both off when motion is sensed. I don\u2019t know what people are doing where they can\u2019t turn that off.  Motion sensing: Pretty slick, you can set a irregular squares to areas of interest you want notifications. For example. One cam captures the street, but I only want my walkway. So I set that section to only alert if movement is noticed in that area. Even nicer, you can set up to 4 different sections.  Noise sensing/notification: Far too sensitive even on the lowest setting. A good gust of wind will set it off. This is nitpicking, but wanted to address it. All my noise sensing is turned off.  2 way communication. It\u2019s OK. Not great. You can hear the people through the camera OK, but the speaker to them is not that great, but again. 42-50$ it\u2019s very good. I will say, it\u2019s possible that when you\u2019re talking through the camera you mouth is far away from the mic on your phone because you\u2019re also watching the video feed.  Install is straight forward. Mount anywhere 110v is within the 10\u2019 reach of the cord. I bought a 50\u2019 USB extension cable to power one of these cameras where 110v is not nearby and it\u2019s flawless. Can probably power sufficiently with even longer USB extension.  Micro SD card storage: It\u2019s ridiculous that TP-Link hasn\u2019t accurately answered this question. At 1080, the 24/7 recording is approx 12gb a day. So a 256gb card formats at 219gb. Which translates to 18 days of 24/7 recording. The takeaway, at 1080 it takes 12gb a day. Different picture quality will increase or decrease the storage requirement.  Saving from SD card. Again. I don\u2019t know where the issue is. When a notification is received the on screen prompts shows you if it was a person or movement. Touch one off them and the software jumps to that event and starts playing. On the screen you\u2019re watching there\u2019s a \u201cRED RECORD BUTTON\u201d touch that, and it starts to record that selection of video to your phone. You can record anything, not just an event. But the event notification just helps locate the times something happens. Easy. No problem. Stop whining! For those that can\u2019t figure that out, if you need to pull the SD card for insurance or police, you have a legit reason! You won\u2019t be pulling the card daily.  Ending thoughts. If you\u2019re interesting in an inexpensive but high quality camera, look no further. Read more", "We use Kasa smart bulbs in our house and love them. I didn't realize Kasa made cameras, so when I need an outdoor camera for security, I went with another brand. While it \"worked\", the alerts were endless as it couldn't differentiate between a person, a dog, a car, or a sparrow, we used it for over a year until we changed internet routers and had to try to reset it - remove the backing plate, press the reset, scan a code from your phone with the camera (not easy on a ladder with bright sunlight reflection from the screen), hope that it \"took\", then start all over when it confirmed 3 minutes later that it wasn't connected. Once I finally got it to connect (had to bring it down and inside first and then put it back up outside), the night vision was like looking thru a fog. So, I decided to try this brand. AND I LOVE IT. Set up is a breeze, plug it in, wait for the light to blink, press the + in the app and the camera was linked to the app. It did take a little longer for the WiFi to connect, but once it did, it has performed flawlessly since. I love that I can use the same app that I already have on my phone, it remembers the WiFi password set for the network, I can easily access from my Echo Show to see what's going on (a plus as I work from home and am on my phone constantly thru the day) and I have the choice of a reasonably priced cloud storage plan (the other brand was $79 for 2 cameras when we started, then without warning increased to $135 in 3 months after we purchased!) or use of an SD card. The only downside I have found so far is the power supply - it's a type C cord that plugs into a pronged block (like what's used with a cell phone). These are \"outdoor\" cameras and if they were to be plugged in outside, I can't imagine that they would be waterproof or safe with this type of connection. We use them on the outside of our buildings for security, but run the cords to interior outlets, so they work for us, but would much prefer a weather safe connection if needed. Will be purchasing a couple more for outside and replacing our inside cameras with this brand as well. Read more", "I refuse to pay monthly fees to store my personal video (I am a techie and know how stuff gets hacked) and selected this camera. The camera overall is a great value. The app is intuitive and easy to setup. I purchased the Eufy camera and returned it for this one, and for my use it is superior. There are many reviews that give in depth pro/con of the app and user interface, but I saw none with the two pet peeves I have with this camera. First, the plug which is not waterproof- what were they thinking? This is an exterior camera and I went to plug it into my exterior 'in use' outlet (it has a cover that allows you to have a plug plugged in all the time and has a spot the electrical cord to be protected). Well, this plug is to 'deep' in order for the cover to protect it. So what are you suppose to use? I ended up having to return 2 of the 3 cameras because I couldn't install them because the plugs would be exposed to the elements. Second, I updated my router. Though the wifi name didn't change, I still had to take the camera down to reset it - no ability to update the wifi in the app. Besides those two issues, this is a solid camera and I would recommend it especially for those of us out there who refuse to pay monthly subscription services for stuff that we already own.", "I really love this camera. I did have some connectivity issues a month after I installed it, but customer service sent an firmware update to the camera and it works great now. Night vision works really well.

That said, they are both good. I have spot lights that detect a person on the drive and they provide more than sufficient lighting.

You have to navigate from the camera to the menu to the gallery to see your shot, so there's no gratification for young photographers.  Responses to any buttons pressed are slow and glitchy.  The picture quality is bad (which is understandable, it's a kids camera).  The lanyard is adult sized, so the camera hangs to the knees of a small child.  The first camera we received didn't even work, so we were disappointed to find the replacement to be so frustrating for my 3 year old to use.

My 3 y/o loves playing with them, but it's getting old having to deal with them not working. Had to return this one as well because the unit simply wouldn't stay powered on after a day, even while plugged in. I noticed the picture quality was worse than the previous model, the shutter speed was insanely slow, and the selfiie mode is entirely out of his understanding on how to turn on. In case you were wondering - since it's not in the instructions at all - I figured out you have to press and hold the shutter button for a good 3 seconds to flip the camera around. The other model only took a single button press, and my kid loved to take pictures of himself making funny faces. He basically can't do that now because he doesn't understand to press and hold the button. Seriously, if you're gonna spend $20-30, skip this one and just take a chance at one of the more popular brands.  Edit: Dropped to 1*. Received a replacement until, and this one broke after two days.

I had a fairly cheap digital camera before this (GE X550), and I was looking for something that was a step up while trying to stay to $500 or $600.  This camera has a lot of fancy features. It has what you'd expect from any camera that's above the point-and-shoot level. You can set it to full auto exposure, manual, aperture priority, or shutter priority. Etc. The features you'd expect to find in any DSLR or mirrorless camera.  It has a bunch of handy features. Like a burst mode, where as long as you hold the shutter button down it will keep clicking pictures. (Choice of speed ranging from, don't quote me on the numbers, I think something like 5 shots per second up to maybe 20.) Auto-bracket mode: Click a picture and it will automatically take 2 more, one with a slightly darker exposure and one slightly lighter. (How much darker or lighter is a setting, and while I usually use 3 you can also do 5 or 7.) Image stabilization that works very well. I did some night shots hand held with shutter speeds of 1 or 2 seconds and they came out with no obvious blur. Option to have a constant brightness on the viewfinder or to have the brightness reflect what the picture will look like. One thing that you may think of as cute fluff but I think is pretty handy: You can set it so that the image shows up on the LCD panel, in the viewfinder, or you can have it use the LCD panel but then automatically switch to the viewfinder when you put your eye up to it. Or to me handiest option of all: the LCD panel folds out (I presume to protect the screen), so if the LCD panel is \"open\" it uses that, if it's closed it uses the viewfinder. Auto focus or manual focus. (It has a feature they claim will keep a moving object in focus, I haven't tried to use that.) Lots of other settings and options that I haven't played with much (or don't understand :-)  It doesn't have changeable lenses, but the built-in lens has like a 20X zoom.  Aperture ranges from F/2.8 to F/8.0. Shutter speeds range from open until you release the button to I think 1/4000 of a second. There's a choice between electronic and mixed electronic/mechanical shutter. If you use the electronic shutter the shutter speeds can be even faster but there are some limitations with it. (The \"mixed\" mode opens the shutter electronically but closes it mechanically.)  The camera will also take video. I've only played with this briefly, mostly I wanted a still camera, so I can't say a lot about that.  There are a bunch of \"creative\" options, like you can take pictures in sepia tones, very high contrast, soft focus, etc.  The menus can be accessed with buttons to scroll around or by using the touch screen. The controls you're likely to want to use all the time, setting the basic mode (S/A/M/P etc), shutter speed, focus, zoom, couple of others, are buttons or knobs. Common options are quickly reached from a few main buttons, like ISO speed, white balance, and focus mode. And there's a customizable \"quick menu\", so if you routinely use some feature you can set it to be reachable fairly easily without having to scroll through all the menus.  Drawbacks I've noticed:  You can't swap lenses. It's got a zoom lens that's permanently attached.  It's ability to give a shallow depth of field is limited. If you like to take portraits, for example, with a blurred background, you may have difficulty achieving this. I want to play with this some more.  I'm sure a professional photographer could point to more limitations but that's all I've really noticed so far. Read more", "I've been a hobby/amateur photographer for about 10 years now. I went from a simple point and shoot to an early Canon Rebel, which was probably the wrong move in hindsight. Having to switch lenses all the time for a day out with the family for \"snaps\" got so annoying that I stopped bringing a camera and relied on our phones. Phones can take photos, sure, but unless you're a latest model smartphone user (iphone and pixel) the photos are only ever going to be good enough to share on social media, and *maybe* good enough to print 4x6.  I wanted to get back to shooting photos, but I didn't want the hassle of carrying a bunch of gear with me if we were just going to an amusement park, or at a picnic. I looked at Canon bridge/superzoom cameras, (all I had ever owned) but at the 400 dollar range, there was always something about the cameras that I didn't like. Nikon was no better. My sister bought a P900, with it's 600mm zoom, so I looked at that, but I wasn't impressed with the video features (something I have an interest in), the stabilization, lack of hot shoe, and the aperture settings on the lens.  Shopping for cameras means compromise. A bridge/superzoom camera is a compromise. You get a small sensor, and you're stuck with the lens that's on it. With the constant f2.8 Leica lens, I started looking hard at the FZ300, and found that it's a VERY popular camera worldwide. Graham Houghton has a ton of tutorial videos on YouTube for the camera, and a user's guide on Amazon that dives super deep into the camera's functions and features. If you want to get creative with photography, and want to have an inexpensive all purpose camera, the Panasonic Lumix FZ300 is an excellent choice. The 4k video is great, but most people will only ever use 1080p. The nice thing about 4k is that it can be downsampled to 1080p to produce super clean video. What is really neat about the FZ300 is the 4k photo mode, which gives you burst photos at 30 frames per second. Great to get action shots of your kid's sports, or wildlife action.  Pros: Convenient all in one camera for quick snaps Plenty of \"creative\" modes Full Manual control for advanced amateurs Fast f2.8 glass 4K video, Photo modes TILTY FLIPPY TOUCHSCREEN. You'll fall in love with this feature. I did. Image stabilization  Cons: 12MP is small for 2019, but about max for this sensor size 24mm isn't very wide angle Small sensor (typical with most bridge cameras at this price) High ISO performance is weak (typical for sensor size) Battery and memory card slot on the bottom interferes with tripod quick release (there is a solution)  Overall:  Fantastic performer for the price. Not as compact as a 100 dollar point and shoot, but a wonderful start to a photography hobby, or for someone who wants a GOOD camera without the headaches of interchangeable lenses. With the addition of the 4K video, it's perfect for someone who is interested in photography and videography. You can step up to the FZ1000 or FZ2500, but you lose zoom range, but gain MP and sensor size, but you're paying DSLR prices for those cameras. If your budget is $1000 and you want a great camera, look at Canon and Nikon APS-C size DSLRs with 2 kit lenses. If your budget is $4-500 you really can't beat this little gem.

My first one held up for 6 years before the main zoom function stopped working (the secondary zoom control still worked). The lens was not as clear anymore, but I had it out in all kinds of weather, swinging around my neck and banging against things. Bought a second one recently. It was good out of the box, just like the 1st one. I do a lot of wildlife and birding (amateur) photography when I hike, so I am constantly zooming in and out. I bought this same cam twice because it is still the best one at its price point after all these years. I was hoping it had come down in price, but it cost the same as 7 years ago. I highly recommend getting an extra battery. I always bring 3 batteries on my trips and almost always use 2 at least. Really fun camera for amateurs. Pro lenses to get the same range of zoom would cost a fortune. It can handle a lot of wear and tear too. Love it!!!", "Sali de una webcam logitech que hab\u00eda usado por algunos a\u00f1os para este modelo y me ha servido para mejorar la calidad de mis videos.", "I've had this camera for a while now and am finally getting around to posting my impressions.  Overall, I think the camera is great, both at shooting photos as well as videos. No camera is perfect, but I've found very few faults for the type of shooting I do.  Autofocus: The FZ300 uses contrast detect autofocus, with a feature called Depth From Defocus (DFD). DFD can know how far focus is off when you press the shutter, and in which direction to go to get it perfect. This means that autofocus is very good, and especially very fast. It really snaps into focus with no hunting. It can also use the whole sensor to focus, instead of just a reduced number of areas. It is said that phase detect, used by other manufacturers is better for video, but I've found the contrast detect with DFD just fine.  Lens: the lens has an 35mm equivalent of 25mm to 600mm, which means it goes from quite wide angle to long telephoto. What is spectacular is that it covers this whole range with an aperture of f/2.8, which is rare. So the lens lets in more light than many other cameras of this type. After working with this lens, I would never go back to a camera with interchangeable lenses. I have all I need right now, without the hassle of changing lenses.  Sensor: the sensor is small at 1/2.3\", which can translate to bad low light capability. The FZ300 compensates with the large aperture, and an image processing engine (called Venus) which does a good job of reducing the noise when there is some present. The advantage of a small sensor is increased depth of field, which makes focusing a lot easier.  A few nice features: - The camera is weather sealed, which protects it from dust and water. Don't use it for underwater photography though, as it isn't designed for it and would certainly not survive. - The swivel screen lets you shoot from up high, or from low to the ground. Once you use one, you'll never want to be without it. - The viewfinder, which you don't have on some other cameras, or smartphones, is nice for shooting in bright light, like on a sunny day, where the screen is hard to see. - It has a built-in flash. It isn't as powerful as a dedicated flash on a hotshoe, but still does a good job and is always there when you need it. - It can shoot in both raw and jpeg, or just one of them if you wish.

I had this camera for a good few months before i actually sat down and decided to see how everything worked. The camera in its entirety is actually pretty good for the price but of course it has its flaws.  I will say that this camera doesn\u2019t hook up to wifi for some reason. I\u2019ve tried looking for videos and everything but nothing worked. I feel like this camera is a different version than what other people on social media have but aside from the camera not hooking up to wifi or bluetooth, the camera is pretty good.  The basic settings are easy to change and everything! But i also wanna say that the color settings for when you\u2019re making a video is a bit frustrating.  Like i could be recording in my house in the daytime with the natural lighting and no camera flash on and if i have the screen color setting on \u201cauto\u201d, it would make me look rather pale/lifeless and make the room look gloomy rather than vibrant like how it would be outside. and then if i were to change the screen color setting to \u201csunny\u201d, it would make me look orange in the house (refer to the video) and still make outside look a vibrant. so the settings are rather confusing so i would definitely pay attention to that when making videos.  and lastly, i wanna say that you definitely are gonna need a good microphone. it sounds veryyyyy muffled without one. but honestly if you get the mic and have your camera settings set to your preference for taking vids/pics, you got yourself a great vlogging camera for under $100! WHO\u2019S GONNA BEAT THAT BRO??  overall, everything is pretty cool with this camera and i would get it as someone who doesn\u2019t wanna pay for a super great quality camera like Sony or Canon, especially considering that i\u2019m JUST starting to vlog and is trying to get the hang of things. :) Read more", "I brought this camera for my niece and she loves it.

Connectivity to the app, as well as the usability of the overall system, is fairly easy.", "perfect live cam and so easy to use with the app on my phone. Intercom works well too. I think its a great value.", "MUBVIEW Baby Monitor with Camera and Audio. Let's start the review with an overall design. I love the look and the feel of it. Little elegant looking camera that looks like a furniture accent, blends well with the interior. Good quality device.Comes with instructions, a mounting bracket and screws, and a USB/AC plug.  One could stand it on a surface or screw to the ceiling upside down (in the settings you would need to flip the screen). The electrical cable is relatively somewhat short, but since it's a USB, you could potentially get an extension USB cable (not included). This camera must be plugged in at all times to function.  The quality of the still images is superb, even in night mode, and the live feed is very good. You can select between qualities of the pictures, but keep in mind it will consume your SD card faster at HD images. The two way audio is good quality, you need to press a mike button on your phone, to speak, but the camera speaker is always on. There is a bit of a lag in audio/video, but that is normal from my experience. You could make screenshots and instantly share them, which is very convenient. You can zoom with your fingers off the screen. Remotely controlling the camera is easy, and effective, it rotates almost full circle, and has a good range top to bottom. If installed right, the camera can overlook the entire room on its own. Great peripheral field of view. Also of note the night mode takes pictures and has a live feed in black and white, versus daytime is in colour.  I couldn't find the sd card slot initially, its hidden behind the lens, you would have to roll the lens all the way up (see the pictures). Unfortunately The sd card is not included, so i could not test it with it, i would have to buy one later. The installation is fairly straightforward, you download the app, and follow the instruction wizard, register, connect and you are good to go. Plenty of languages for your interface to chose from (see pics).  Motion detection works well (i turned it off because every time the dog walks by it sends you a message, which is good if you need this working well). Easy access from the app to the live feed, no authentication needed, which on certain products is quite annoying.  The recording and data storage available in 2 options: SD card, or cloud storage. The amazon product description ad mentions a free 7 day loop recording storage cloud, but all i could find is an offer for a subscription, I will be calling the customer service to verify this information, because it is a little confusing (see pictures).  Overall we are very satisfied with the product, its priced fair, and performs well. 5/5 Read more", "Wir haben uns f\u00fcr zwei dieser Kameras entschieden, um unseren Hund in unserer Abwesenheit beobachten zu k\u00f6nnen.

It was pretty easy to set up when you follow the instructions and the video quality is also good (both day time and night vision). The one thing that I would note (and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that is does not come with an SD card which you need for storage. If you don't use an SD card, you'll have to sign up for cloud storage which has a subscription cost. Other than that, I'd say that the camera is at a fair price point for the quality you get!"], "Image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512JB+Iz6sL._AC_SY300_SX300_.jpg", "Link": "https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MToyNDIzNDIyNjY3NjkwMjQ6MTcwNjE3MDA5NTpzcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWM6MjAwMTY2ODYzNTE0MDk4OjoxOjo&url=%2FMUBVIEW-Security-Cameras-Tracking-Two-Way%2Fdp%2FB0BXWJXGQV%2Fref%3Dsxin_12_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa%3Fcontent-id%3Damzn1.sym.17ce8337-8e69-4ba8-805c-ec7214955809%253Aamzn1.sym.17ce8337-8e69-4ba8-805c-ec7214955809%26cv_ct_cx%3Dcamera%26keywords%3Dcamera%26pd_rd_i%3DB0BXWJXGQV%26pd_rd_r%3D5c9e0999-1cee-49b4-a69d-1620737d0213%26pd_rd_w%3DZbAn1%26pd_rd_wg%3DqVAFr%26pf_rd_p%3D17ce8337-8e69-4ba8-805c-ec7214955809%26pf_rd_r%3DAZSTSVYNNJMV8CXA42VX%26qid%3D1706170095%26sbo%3DRZvfv%252F%252FHxDF%252BO5021pAnSA%253D%253D%26sr%3D1-33-f853d353-bf33-45e7-b5c2-2cb2b31abc9b-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWM%26psc%3D1"}, {"Name": "Fujifilm Instax Mini 11 Instant Camera - Lilac Purple", "Price": "76.50", "Details": ["Slim body size with transparent ring lens", "Automatic exposure - The Mini 11 automatically selects the optimal shutter speed in any environment.

Great price too!", "I bought this camera because I like having the ability to check on my pets while at work. When I upgraded my home WiFi to 5G, I found that my old cameras were no longer compatible. It took a bit of searching to find a camera that was 5G compatible (many claimed to be, but then reviewers shared that they weren\u2019t actually) and affordable, and I am glad that I landed on this product. The camera itself is lightweight and small, which makes it possible to position it in a variety of places without it being an eyesore or adding too much extra weight to a shelf. I think that it blends in well. I have been using my camera consistently for about 3 weeks now. I was a bit worried during set up because I had to go through the process twice before the camera connected to my WiFi in the app, but since then I have had zero issues with connectivity or anything else.

For just a camera to watch my dog it's well suited to that. It sits on a table and for me, that's all I wanted it for. It comes with an SD card installed so you don't have to mess with that.

Overall, it's a decent outdoor camera with several positive aspects, but one particular issue has been a source of occasional frustration. Here's my moderate review:  Pros:  1. **Video Quality:** The EZVIZ Outdoor camera delivers crisp 1080p video quality during the day. Colors are vivid, and details are reasonably clear, providing a good visual feed of the outdoor area.  2. **Night Vision:** The camera's night vision capabilities are commendable. It provides clear footage in low-light conditions, ensuring that your property remains monitored around the clock.  3. **Sturdy Build:** The camera is well-constructed and designed for outdoor use. It feels durable and is equipped to handle various weather conditions.  4. **Easy Installation:** Setting up the camera was relatively straightforward, thanks to the clear instructions provided in the package. The mobile app also guided me through the process smoothly.  5. **Mobile App:** The EZVIZ app is user-friendly and allows for remote viewing, playback, and configuration. It's a convenient way to access your camera's feed and make adjustments on the go.  Cons:  1. **Random Motion Detection:** My primary gripe with this camera is its motion detection system. It tends to trigger false alarms due to seemingly random factors like changes in lighting, moving shadows, or even insects flying by. This can be quite annoying, leading to unnecessary notifications and recordings.  2. **Limited Motion Detection Zones:** While the app does allow you to set specific areas for motion detection, the zones are somewhat limited in shape and size. More flexible customization options would be appreciated.  3. **Occasional Connectivity Hiccups:** Although rare, I've experienced intermittent connectivity issues with the camera, resulting in temporary loss of access to live footage and recordings. A more stable connection would enhance reliability.  4. **No Free Cloud Storage:** The absence of complimentary cloud storage for recorded footage means that you'll need to invest in a subscription plan if you want to access historical recordings.  In conclusion, the EZVIZ Outdoor 1080P WiFi security camera is a solid choice for outdoor surveillance, with its commendable video quality and sturdy build. However, the occasional false alarms caused by the motion detection system can be frustrating. If you can overlook this minor issue or plan to use the camera in an area with minimal motion, it's a reasonably priced option. Just keep in mind the potential for periodic notification overload due to the random motion detection quirks.

Included is a 32GB TF card but can handle up to 256 GB (and I have one spare in my bag). I like that this camera has a boot mounting which can accommodate a flash unit or a boom external microphone.

This is thee best value i've found so far of any camera. Does it compete with a brand name camera for 3 times the price, no but its not that far off either. The real value comes in the whole package you get, for any name brand camera, you get 1 battery, no charger, and no SD card (G-Anica included a sandisk extreme 32gb) I recorded a few test clips as well as the kiddo, and I doubt its 4k like my sony, but for a 10th of the price, it will work perfect for him to start his youtube adventure.  Other reviewers are spot on with the slow focus, its a bit of a learning curve from what i'm used to, but it works, thats the important part. One thing I noticed my son struggled to understand how to format the SD card, we were only able to get it to format on a certain setting.

This camera is for the Grandparent who wants to take good family photos in a well-lit area. People like that will love this little camera. It's lightweight and dummy-proof.  I took a photo of myself inside the house with only the natural light of the room. Also I took a photo of myself sitting outside in the sun. (see the photos) As you can see, this camera is not a good choice if you will need something that performs well in low light. If you are outside or in a well-lit space this camera will be great for any non-professional simply wanting a camera.  If you go into this purchase with the right expectations you will enjoy this inexpensive camera. It's small and very lightweight when compared to my Sony A7. The lightweight nature also makes this feel cheap. I wouldn't want to drop or bump this too many times.  Connecting to computer: This camera is easy enough for anyone not very tech savvy. I didn't even read the manual. I simply plugged in the USB-C cable that came with the camera and it worked perfectly with my iMac computer.  The camera comes with two batteries, a charger that will charge both, a 32gb sd macro card, a Micro USB adapter, and a lens wipe. You get a lot of bang for your buck with this camera. Once you buy this camera you won't need anything else to go with it.  You can use this camera directly connected to your computer. Simply select PC Mode after you connect the camera to the computer. That's one reason I wanted to try this little camera. I had a problem with viewing myself from the camera while connected to the computer. The monitor that's connected to the camera doesn't show the image while connect to the computer. That defeats the purpose of having a screen that flips 180 degrees. While in PC mode the camera will show an image of a camera lens and not the image you are sending to the computer. This might be my personal ignorance. Perhaps this can be solved by a camera setting. Not sure  The manual said there's an issue with laptops that already have webcams. You may need to disable your webcam before this camera works. Keep in mind I didn't have this problem when connecting to my computer. The camera showed up in OBS fine. I just couldn't see the image on the camera which is a minus for me.  The quality is fine if you're not expecting professional results. You can easily use the camera with OBS. I might use this camera for Zoom meetings. Most likely I'll just stick with my iPhone because of the low-light performance.  My Rating of this camera 3 of 5 Minus on low-light performance and the monitor not showing while connected to the computer. Plus on features, extra included items, and the lightweight nature of this camera. Great gift for your young children, parent, or grandparent. It will make them feel smart and good about themself.

The video quality is medium-high, and for what it is, I can not complain. It's a great little camera.  I will complain about the app, because it's over 300 megs but very clunky to use and doesn't give you full access to the video files stored on the SD card. If you want to retrieve footage, you can do a playback and local-record (uses your device's screen capture video record feature) but this introduces latency and glitched audio. You also can't scrub forward and back very easily in the video, there are only back 30-seconds and forward 30-seconds buttons, or a timeline you have to pinch-zoom in order to scroll forward/back in time. It's not at all intuitive and difficult to use when trying to review and share footage with a police officer.  The app really needs to give us access to the raw and unadulterated files without having to physically remove the SD card every time somebody gets arrested for shoplifting.  So yeah, the app sucks. But they have a beta testing program and development forums, so there's some hope for the future.  Technical notes: After using these cams for a month, I can tell you some statistics about video size and storage. Here is a table to help you decide which size SD card to buy. Video will overwrite itself once the card is filled, so how many days of video is that?  512 GB card = 34 days of recording. 256 GB card = 17 days. 128 GB card = 8.5 days. 64 GB card = 4.25 days. 32 GB card = 2.125 days.  I recommend a Samsung brand Micro SD card. Either a Samsung PRO Endurance or Samsung Pro Plus. The Endurance should last more years (decades if you get a 512 GB card), and the Pro Plus will let you copy off footage a bit faster (and should still last for decades).

If you just want a few cameras for inside your house, this is a great option provided you have wifi coverage at every location. The cameras are somewhat easy to install.. I had a lot of problems with the first two when it came to making a bluetooth connection.  The update process (firmware) is straightforward and once you have the cameras set up with wifi and your account they work pretty well. Night vision is fine and the resolution of the camera is good for the price. I've only used the voice/sound feature as a joke a couple of times, but it worked well enough.  What I dislike is the app. I give it 10% odds of crashing any time I open an alert. It'll just back out of the current screen, or the whole app will go black. Not a fan at all, albeit it is convenient to be able to view the cameras through your phone.  The tilt on this unit is also a little finicky.

Originally bought it to look out the window towards the driveway, but unfortunately during the night the cameras infrared LEDs blind itself, rendering it useless for my original set up. Now I have it watch over my dogs crate while away from home.", "I had a camera in my garage that always went out. No WiFi. But when I got rid of the camera and replaced it with this one I've had no issues. Plus I get better quality. Well worth the price.", "I've been using Amazon Cloudcam since it's inception, unfortunately Amazon has discontinued that service. I was quite happy with it, cameras had good video quality (all things considered when they first came out), performance was good, desktop viewing, easy to load recorded clips.  Being forced to get a new camera was daunting, I did as much research as possible and chose the Google Nest cam. Yearly subscription and features seemed good, cameras were reasonably priced compared to Ring and came with the Google Home ecosystem which was promising.  Got my cameras, installed them and then all the issues started. First, there is NO WAY to watch your cameras from a desktop browser, this seems extremely nuts for me, how does Google, a tech powerhouse have no option for this? For my Amazon cameras, I would just log into cloudcam.amazon.com and instantly watch all my cameras at once. When I'm at work it was an easy way to monitor all my cameras at once. But for Google Nest, nope, you have to watch from your phone. Not ideal when I'm at work and you can't watch on a big screen. I can not express the amount of disappointment this brings. Apparently before Google bought Nest you could watch them on a desktop. So disappointing.  I placed my new cameras on the same spots as my old Amazon Cloudcams, they are reasonably located from my WiFi router and boosters. My 4 year old Cloudcams performed flawlessly from these locations, video streaming loaded right away. Google Nest cameras constantly refresh with a black screen and give me constant \"Live video unavailable\". So far owning them for 4ish days I get that message 90% of the time. Performance has been extremely underwhelming for a Google product. How can brand new cameras perform so poorly compared to 4 year old \"obsolete\" technology.  You want to watch recorded video clips? Good luck, they take FOREVER to load. By the time they load your house has already been robbed. Clips taking up to a minute to load. These are recorded clips in the cloud, how can this be so slow? Again on my Amazon Cloudcam it takes about 3-5 seconds for a 5 minute clip to load. Google Nest takes up to a minute to load a 10 second clip.  When the camera works (and its not often) the video quality is great, night vision feature is sharp, motion detection is also great. Unfortunately though the Google ecosystem is extremely subpar. Their Home app is also something to be desired. It seems so rushed and poorly designed, like a last minute \"we need an app\" situation. The lack of customizing where you want icons placed are also so so bad.  As for customer service, I chatted them today trying to get help, I've been on the chat so far for 36 minutes getting the same copy and paste answers from their CS person. Took 20 minutes for them to get figure out how to get me to approve for them to get into my system. Going on 40 minutes they ask me for a screenshot. Big yikes Google.  I want to like the cameras but ultimately I will return them all (I spent north of $500 on all of these). Maybe try the more expensive Ring or cheaper Wyzecam.  If you're looking for an easy setup camera system with little frustration, these are not it.  Update: over 1.5 hours with Google support and they seemed clueless. Telling me to uninstall the app, turn off the cameras, asking me what phone I was using, it was all useless. Most of them I already did. Anyway, all 4 cameras have been returned to Amazon.  While I was on the chat for over 1.5 hours I researched other cameras and decided to go with Wyzecam. $99 a year for unlimited cameras, web browsing included, color night vision. Cheaper pricepoint on the hardware too. Read more", "Installation worked very well.

Overall, it's a decent outdoor camera with several positive aspects, but one particular issue has been a source of occasional frustration. Here's my moderate review:  Pros:  1. **Video Quality:** The EZVIZ Outdoor camera delivers crisp 1080p video quality during the day. Colors are vivid, and details are reasonably clear, providing a good visual feed of the outdoor area.  2. **Night Vision:** The camera's night vision capabilities are commendable. It provides clear footage in low-light conditions, ensuring that your property remains monitored around the clock.  3. **Sturdy Build:** The camera is well-constructed and designed for outdoor use. It feels durable and is equipped to handle various weather conditions.  4. **Easy Installation:** Setting up the camera was relatively straightforward, thanks to the clear instructions provided in the package. The mobile app also guided me through the process smoothly.  5. **Mobile App:** The EZVIZ app is user-friendly and allows for remote viewing, playback, and configuration. It's a convenient way to access your camera's feed and make adjustments on the go.  Cons:  1. **Random Motion Detection:** My primary gripe with this camera is its motion detection system. It tends to trigger false alarms due to seemingly random factors like changes in lighting, moving shadows, or even insects flying by. This can be quite annoying, leading to unnecessary notifications and recordings.  2. **Limited Motion Detection Zones:** While the app does allow you to set specific areas for motion detection, the zones are somewhat limited in shape and size. More flexible customization options would be appreciated.  3. **Occasional Connectivity Hiccups:** Although rare, I've experienced intermittent connectivity issues with the camera, resulting in temporary loss of access to live footage and recordings. A more stable connection would enhance reliability.  4. **No Free Cloud Storage:** The absence of complimentary cloud storage for recorded footage means that you'll need to invest in a subscription plan if you want to access historical recordings.  In conclusion, the EZVIZ Outdoor 1080P WiFi security camera is a solid choice for outdoor surveillance, with its commendable video quality and sturdy build. However, the occasional false alarms caused by the motion detection system can be frustrating. If you can overlook this minor issue or plan to use the camera in an area with minimal motion, it's a reasonably priced option.

This camera has failed to record almost every actual person who comes on my property, even in broad daylight. It does however send me 50 notifications a night every time my neighbors motion activated spotlight goes off at night. I use the memory card and dont have a subscription, which is why I bought these. I have neighbors who harass me and wander all over my property high on meth at night. Every single time I have needed to see whats going on, it didnt record it. The camera freezes when I need to check it live, but only if theres a person there. When I've tried to see what was recently recorded in the middle of an emergency, it stopped working and demanded a subscription. But I can watch hours of footage of my neighbors light going on and off all night any time. Its as if they are programmed to exploit actual emergencies. This has happened so many times, I dont know what else to think. One camera just stopped recording things for a year and randomly started recording again.

Yes I was looking for the impossible, an inexpensive digital camera with a fairly descent zoom and good features. Can this camera take pictures in rapid succession? No. In continuous mode it will do 3 shots at 1 FPS. Can you zoom in on the pictures and see good detail? Yes and No. Even set at 20meg the images sometimes do not bear close scrutiny if taken under low light, like indoors at night. But with enough light on the subject it takes excellent images. Did I experience a lag when taking pictures? Well yes and no. The camera takes a little getting used to. While the closest focusing distance on full wide is 5 inches, once you start to use the zoom, that close focusing distance extends out to 5 feet. So if what you want to take a picture of is within 5 feet, just keep the camera on wide and walk up to take the shot. If you can't walk up to take the picture then use the zoom. Until I figured this out I was very frustrated wondering why the camera would not lock focus on the subject. So after all of these faults why have I given this camera 5 stars. Well you get what you pay for. I have a Sony DSLR and a Sony all in one. Both cost about $1,000 at the time of purchase. Those take fantastic pictures but you can't fit them in a shirt pocket. It is unfair to compare a camera that costs a little over $100 to those. But for what I intended, this little DSC-W830 is fantastic. I get very descent shots which I view on my 27\" monitor. It fits conveniently in a pocket and (once you understand the controls and get used to how it handles) takes pictures quickly and accurately enough for my needs. If I need better I get out my more expensive cameras. But for convenience and ease of use this little camera is a gem. Read more", "This is an open letter/review to the Sony Corporation :  First let me say I don't write product reviews, and I buy a LOT of products from Amazon. I am a building / home inspector and as such (recently did the math) I take upwards of 500 - 600 photos a week for my inspection reports that people rely on to purchase perhaps the biggest purchase of their lives - their home. I bought this camera in February of 2015 (14 months ago) and after ~33,000 photos, my beloved DSC-W380 has finally met its match by way of a lens booger.  NOW, let me get to the point. Being the centerpiece of my livelihood and the tool that has captured more construction sites, floor decking, landscaping, electrical components, low lighting conditions of every kind, frost, rain, (and yes even falling off a building... action shot ; )) I was troubled when its tiny little heart gave up on me (natural death). Since then I have tried virtually every Point and Shoot on the market $200 and under, $200 and over, Sony, Nikon, Canon, done side by sides, swam in camera specs that would make any sane person's head spin, and have come to one resolute conclusion... If you are in the inspection business and need an amazing quality image on the quick, this is it.  I'm not selling cameras here, so let me get back to my letter. SONY... PLEASE, PLEASE... DO NOT DISCONTINUE THIS CAMERA. It is the perfect marriage of low light taking, no nonsense, perfect design for working professional (love the thumb zoom... can and will never zoom with my index finger... thumb on zoom, trigger finger on trigger... amen), perfect optics, aluminum non-plastic tough as nails shell, perfect amount of zoom... I could go on. This is a timeless camera for a no-nonsense user and should NEVER be discontinued.  Thank you Sony for the genesis of this camera, and your attention to this open letter, I would guess I'm speaking for a large swath of real estate inspectors everywhere. Phenomenal camera, just repurchased after at least 30 hours of research, hands-on experimentation, etc (03/16)...I will not buy anything other than the DSC-W830 for my main work camera.  Kind Regards Read more", "I was needing a small camera for product photography. I have a dslr, but wanted something smaller and comparable to a smart phone when it comes to quality and portability. After much research, I settled on the Sony DSCW830. Partially because of the reviews & price, and partially because my current dslr is a older Sony model which has a similar menu. I've already taken a bunch of test shots with it, and so far I'm really digging it. Now, don't get me wrong, this wont replace your dslr camera. I wouldn't use this to take action shots. This would not be my \"go to\" camera on Christmas morning, as it takes entirely too long for it to snap the picture ... However, for my needs it's perfect. The macro setting is where this camera really shines, as it takes very crisp photos of small subjects. It also seems to perform well for taking shots where the subject can sit still and pose for you. The video quality is more than sufficient and seems just as good, if not better than most smart phones. The battery life is good for this size of camera, and it charges up pretty quickly. All in all, it's a good little budget friendly camera if you use it for the right things.  Pros- Size Value Quality Easy menu system Good for shooting 'still' subjects  Cons- Doesn't come with a case Not good for taking action shots Read more", "This is a great little camera. I have used it on many occasions and for general picture taking it gives high quality and high pixel photos. It is in now standard form where the rear screen is used to select the picture. The camera has a flash and the focusing has a reasonable range.  However there are some things worth noting:  1. I cannot get good macro close ups of flowers. The combination of a poor macro and the rear image have yielded several out of focus pictures.  2. There is a significant time lag between taking pictures, 5 to 7 seconds before you can snap another. I do not know why this is the case so if you are trying to snap some fast motion pics this may not be for you.  Overall it fits neatly in a pocket and unless you rely solely upon you smart phone this is a well priced option for quality pictures in general.", "Produto de Excelente Qualidade e Entrega rigorosamente no prazo.", "Very small compact camera.

I think this makes for a very good vlogging camera especially if you are stationary, or using a tripod. The overall build of the camera feels pretty solid with a couple small features that seem odd. I really like the included lens cover. As well as the little carry bag. Excellent for traveling and being able to throw it in a backpack while on the go. With that said I find it to be a little odd that the lens spins on its exterior like it should be adjustable- but there are buttons for actually adjusting zoom.

Well-arranged and everything feels branded including the box in which it comes. Also, out of the box, I was impressed with the setup. For the price & picture quality, I would recommend this camera.

The camera supports up to 128GB - Comes with 2 battery included - Detailed instruction manual included for reference - Warranty provided by the manufacturer  Cons: - I wish there was a carrying case included in the bundle too - I wish they bundled 64 or 128 GB card in the pack since 32GB would fill so soon when videos at high resolution are shot Read more", "The box comes with a card, batteries, and all the cables.

The controls are not difficult and the ability to download all photos and videos to your computer can allow you to have some fun if you have a video editor. The instruction booklet was acceptable but it did identify all functions and locations, a few things I had to figure out myself so unless you have really smart kids (and they might be smarter than you with this) you might want to familiarize yourself with its operation so you know how to get the pictures out and maybe reset the settings if one of them gets into the settings and messes anything up.  NOTE: The fact they included 2 batteries so you should never run out of power when you are out on a trip or something is a real bonus over others.  I didn't fully understand how to use this little camera, how hard could this be, I finally understood what to do, it does help when you read the instruction booklet. So I tried to put the battery in, it would not go in, so I took a closer look at the opening where the battery does go and I noticed a little black notch (it is also keyed to prevent inserting it the wrong way), I held the notch down with one finger and pushed the battery in, it went in and then I proceeded to turn the camera on, It Worked!!! WoW! I was really excited! then I remembered I needed to get a memory card for it, but it turns out they gave me a memory card (32 Gig) This little gem of a camera takes beautiful, clear pictures and video...I'm really glad that I bought this!! :)  Bottom Line: It is a camera that would have been professional level before everyone had a phone with a camera built in, it appears sturdy, it comes with a lanyard and a pouch to help keep it from getting laid down and lost plus it takes really good pictures so 5 Stars for a great deal for something a you will love if if you desire to produce really professional looking pictures and video.

I now use the HD (1080P) setting full time and only rarely get the \"Poor Network\" message, but I do still get it.  Update July 2, 2020: 1. Make certain battery is charged to 100% before you use it, I can't stress this enough. 2. Unless you don't care if you can use the 1080P video you paid for, have this camera as close to your very powerful router as you can get or it will force you to use :Fluent: which is kind of blurry. I have tried everything I can think of and even though my camera is only about 15 feet from my very expensive Range Extender )Linksys RE7000 *) I can't get it to run 1080P successfully. It keeps telling me that my network is flaky. Anyway, I really like all the other aspects of this camera. It seems very stabile and provides a very wide image and, at 1080P it has a very clear image. Even though ReoLink recommends against it I am going to try a different antenna. The one the ship is only 2dBi gain which is ok in normal circumstances but I guess my circumstances aren't normal.. I found one on Amazon (where else?) that was designed to work with Security Cameras and is 5dBi gain and maybe longer. I know it can't damage the camera and I feel it could help me in this situation. I will come back here to update this review either way.  * This is a different one from the one I talk about below =================================================================================== Update June 26, 2020: I finally have one gripe, sorry.. I actually went out and bought a good Wi-Fi extender, to see if it would solve the apparent bandwidth problem even though my iPhone was seeing max bars a the install location the camera would present the \"Due to poor Wi-Fi reception it is suggested that you use \"Fluid\" resolution (whatever that is) instead of 1080P\". Sorry to say it didn't help. I am presently working with Reolink support to resolve this hopefully. Having said all that I still feel this is a great product  Update June 15, liking it more all the time. Reolink customer service has indicated a willingness to listen to some of our suggestions, perhaps even implementing some of them, of course I won't hold my breath.  On a more positive note:  1. The battery hasn't dropped lower than 82% that I know of, maybe at night, however. Of course we have had a load of the big yellow light in the sky known as the sun. Can hardly wait until next week when we get a week or so of rain.  2. False triggering of alarms remains low, except for the one very windy day we had, when I got a bunch  Update June 14, 2020:  1. Finally got email alerts to work. During the setup process you need to input the port used by your email server, in my case Outlook. The number suggested by the setup process is wrong you need to use port 587. However, if you get a lot of false detections you are going to get a lot of emails. I turned this feature off.  2. As for the windows client problem, my advice is to read the user guide provided. You need to use the camera's UID not the IP address.  I finally did heard from Reolink service and they seem to want to be very helpful. They told me that the phone number I contacted is a scam. They don't charge for in warranty and sometimes, out of warranty service. The say they are looking into some of the problems:  1. Having to renew the \"free\" cloud subscription every month 2. The inability to delete images/videos from the SD card  I consistently have been getting 4 bars of 2.4g WiFi yet sometimes I have trouble connecting in the app. Yesterday I was in my car in the driveway the app told me I was using cellular when I clearly had a strong WiFi connection on my iPhone 6s =========================================================== Original post:  Installed yesterday, first what I like, it is easier:  1. Image is acceptable. 2. Alerts aren't too bad, yet 3. Same with night vision 4, Hardware and camera are first rate. I totally disagree with negative comments about the Solar Panel mounting arm. I couldn't get the locking screw hole in the camera mount to line up with the screw so I left it out. Unless we have an earthquake or tornado I don't see the camera coming loose 5. The Solar Panel seems to do a great job keeping the battery topped off.  Now on to what I don't like:  1. Setup is NOT easy, for some reason you need to be within a couple of feet for it to connect to the router. I must have gone thru setup a dozen times. 2. Installation was NOT a breeze, see also number 4 above 3. Support from the company is basically non-existent. i contacted their Support number only to be told that I would have to pay $50 for the support I needed 4 Setting up email alerts is difficult I never did get it to work 5. Support documentation is almost non-existent. I guess this is to be expected when you consider number 3 above 6. The \"free\" cloud must be renewed each month, once a year or lifetime of camera, would be more appropriate 7. I don't like the fact that you can't erase individual videos from he Micro SD Card. In order to get rid of they you need to format the card which forces a reboot. Yet they let you erase individual or all videos in the cloud, an oversight perhaps 8. I never got the Windows client to hook to my camera How do I know who the user is and what password is needed?  When all is said and done, however, I feel this camera is one of the best on the market at this price point. Maybe that doesn't say much about the competition, however.  I am hoping the company sees this review Read more", "Though I live in a safe neighborhood in a safe town, no one is immune to unsafe circumstances. I finally decided to buy a Reolink camera after quite some time and lots of research, and chose the Argus Eco+ for what it offers.  1. It charges via solar power! Sure it needs an initial charge out of the box, but it's been charging with no issues where I've placed the camera and the solar panel.  2. It has motion detection! Where I have mounted my camera leaves a bit to be desired in terms of sensitivity, though it captures and records as it should. There is about a 3 second delay when the camera activates and starts recording, so it may have more to do with where I've mounted it that the camera itself.  3. It's able to see at night! Where I live there's about 5 or 6 feral cats, and they prefer to go through my yard and no one elses, so... the PIR motion detection picks works very well! They can be clearly seen, even with the camera in night vision mode.  4. The app is straightforward enough for most to understand! I had a few hiccups figuring out the Reolink app at first, as the in-box leaflet is little help. It works as it should, and I have not experienced any major issues with the camera losing connection. However, the app sometimes doesn't play nice on my phone, running Andriod 12 (it's usually when I get a motion alert and go to look at the feed and it says 'failed to load feed. Tap to retry.' and usually takes 3 tries before it cooperates.) On my Andriod tablet running Android 13/One UI 5.1? Runs like a dream. So... I firmly believe it's my phone and not the camera.

They are simple enough and work great! Until now. We recently had a big storm and had to replace our internet modem. This required reconfiguring all cameras to the new network. 2 of our cameras reset with no issues. 1 camera got water inside somehow, and this my oldest camera that has never moved and never gotten moisture inside before. With moisture inside the lens (pictured) the image would get very foggy also constantly record due to ongoing motion triggering, and the battery wouldn't fully charge. Immediately upon reaching out for support and providing the order number from so long ago a new camera was on it's way at no cost to me!! And the 4th camera did not want to reset for me. I fought with this camera and charged it inside and turned it off and on and pressed the reset button 100x it does work but not without being stubborn. I reset the network finally and put it back in its place outside only to find that the wifi no longer picks up out there. Camera issue? Or possibly new network issue? Regardless I tried resetting it again to connect to a wifi extender and the same stubborn issue happened again. I had been talking back and forth with tech support during this whole ordeal. They were helpful apart from having the weekend off work. But again, immediately upon determining this camera is malfunctioning they sent a new one to replace it. It's still in the mail but no issues with there first replacement. All issues could have been caused by this freak storm. That is why we had to replace our modem in the first place. But I have been completely satisfied otherwise. Would recommend and would purchase again!! With a disclaimer. But thanks to their amazing tech support I have nothing negative to say.

De resto esta muy bien, como la facilidad y las diferentes opciones de configuraci\u00f3n son otros puntos a favor.", "Not really made explicit anywhere but when you turn it on the LCD screen shows what the camera is seeing, which is great for setting it up, and a feature that's been missing on Bushnell cameras (and many others) for years. That was a major reason I bought this one, having to race back and forth to a laptop twenty times to get the image set up right would drive me nuts.  The picture in the manual shows the SD card being inserted upside-down (contacts at the top), it actually goes in face-up.  When the description says it uses SD cards it really does use full-sized SD cards, not micro SD like almost everything else does. If all you've got is micro SD card you'll need to use a plastic SD card adapter for the camera.  The files get big really quickly, a few 30-second videos at medium resolution (1080p) consumed over a gigabyte of space. If you've got a 32GB SD card lying around that you decide to use, it's not going to go far. This is a bit of a problem because while micro SD card capacities keep going up, common full-size SD cards have mostly topped out at 32-64GB. Everything over that size is not common and often stupidly expensive. Looking at a local supplier, they don't even have a 512GB SD card while micro SD cards in the same capacity and from reputable vendors (Samsung, Sandisk, Kingston) are plentiful.  Files are saved as MOV's (QuickTime), circa 1992. I mean, pretty much anything can still play these things, but yeesh! The encapsulated video is H.264 with AAC audio, but the choice of MOV instead of MPG as container format is puzzling.  The camera runs fine off rechargeable NiMHs, just drop in some Eneloops and you won't have to throw away a set of batteries each time they run down.  Someone who did a partial teardown of one pointed out that the screws are inside the gasket rather than outside as is normal for IP67 cases, which means the screw holes present a potential ingress point for moisture. The silicone protective caps for fibre optic connectors are exactly the right size to plug them, but if you don't happen to have those lying around you may want to press a blob of vaseline into each hole to prevent moisture ingress.  If anyone from Bushnell is reading this, Google \"ip67 gasket\" in image mode to see what I mean about how the gasket should be laid out.

I bought this camera specifically to find out what is killing my chickens and hopefully get some time stamps to establish a pattern. I had one recently killed chicken that I put ten feet in front of the camera and left it over night. The next morning the chicken was gone and not a single picture had been taken. A separate time I even watched a hawk land 3 feet in front of the camera with the camera positioned close to the ground so the hawk basically landed right in front of the lens and not a single picture was taken. I have managed to take pictures of deer with this camera though, so I suspect that foxes and hawks just aren't big enough to register on the motion sensor. Pictures are decent when they actually get taken, but this thing is useless for the purpose I purchased it for.", "Works great.

The only thing I find problematic is the range of where it picks up motion. Even though I have it set to low and blocked out areas of the street, it still picks up the cars driving by. Other than that I like it. Connected easily to my wifi and I can access the camera quickly through the app when motion is picked up or if someone rings the bell. I can talk to them as well. And the charge on it can last up to at least a month if you have low activity. I charged it two weeks ago and it\u2019s currently at 75%", "I've had this doorbell installed for about 2 months now, and at this point it's basically useless. 1. The chime constantly loses connection to the doorbell, even when it's placed right on the other side of the door. This is arguably worse than not having any doorbell at all, since visitors ring the doorbell thinking it's notified me and don't knock at all. I would have to keep re-pairing the chime to the doorbell every couple of days, and the chime absolutely eats AA batteries even though it's doing nothing. 2. The motion detection with the camera is alright. The issue is there is a significant delay between when it picks up motion and when it starts recording. Typically all that gets recorded is the back of the delivery person walking away from the door. This isn't an issue for deliveries, but it makes the doorbell camera basically useless for security purposes. 3. The phone app is extremely inconsistent about notifications. Maybe it's just how my phone is set up, but the app doesn't push notifications for rings or motion detection to my lock screen until I interact with the phone in some other way. This means I'll frequently pick up my phone to do something else, only to then receive several notifications that someone's been to my door.  Overall, I'd strongly recommend against this doorbell. I'll be replacing mine with something else, even though I've already passed the window for returning it and getting a refund. This one will be going in the trash. Read more", "**Update: the company reached out to me after my initial review. I was informed that there was a known issue with a batch of the chimes losing connectivity, hence the \"battery\" issue. They sent a new chime, and it has been working for 2+ weeks now with no problems! I've seen this same thing on several other reviews - you may need a new chime. Works well now.  I purchased this for a rental property we moved into. There wasn't a doorbell, and we didn't want to modify wiring. If you are using it through the app only, it's fine. Picture is clear, battery lasts a long time, and notifications are timely.  Unfortunately, the included chime is defective. If I'm gone or not near my phone, no one can tell someone is at the door. It eats through 2 AA batteries every couple of days, even when it's not being used much. It's incredibly inconvenient, expensive, and frustrating. I've reached out to customer service and tried all of their suggestions. The last time, I was told I'd be contacted by email in 48 hours with a resolution but never heard from them again. If you need the chime, go with something else.", "I purchased my first Toucan set (doorbell with the outdoor magnetic camera) back in 2021. One of the cameras fell got scratched but continued working. I recently moved but did not move them with me so I had my roommate get another set. We also ordered the newer improved outdoor infrared camera that is also magnetic. What I really like about the product is the fact that it's magnetic easy to set up and you can move it around I wish they would do that with this doorbell option. Unfortunately we had some heavy winds and somehow it managed to slip out of the door attachment and even though it charges there's been no picture since even though I've reset it a few times. That was about 4 months ago so it's too late to return and I just don't want to deal with customer service so I'm getting a replacement so we ordered another one. I've also owned the blink system and several other ones. By far I prefer the Toucan because even with a free subscription you can still view all of your clips and download them for the past 24 hours. Blink now requires you to pay for a subscription for even view of basic clips and their images are not nearly as clear and does not have the same rotation capabilities once you look at the view. So it was worth buying another one. I refuse to buy any security cameras that require wiring I like to be able to have the portability to move the device from one area to another if needed. One thing I also like about this product is the security alerts and voice messages it will send that you can set up when someone approaches the camera. We had to argue for a few failed deliveries that claimed it was left on our porch. So now when someone approaches it they'll hear you are being recorded..

Many people say that it isn't worth it, and with the development of quality in phone cameras, why even bother buying a digital one that provides less quality photos than that of your phone, that almost everyone has and carries with them at all times? I personally like having a compact, portable camera that is less of an investment than an expensive smart phone in the case it gets stolen, dropped, damaged, etc. This in itself is an appeal for me to purchase a digital camera to use instead of my iPhone. It was a great alternative to my phone, allowing me to keep my phone tucked away in a pocket or a bag, while still being able to take photographs while on my trips. I really liked the red color offered, as I try to buy everything red. The camera itself is compact and portable, it was super easy to conceal and travel with, adding little weight to my travel bags. The camera is very easy to use, allowing different shooting settings, zoom, and even video recordings. The battery lasts quite a while too, but I bought secondary batteries just in case. I also really appreciate the fact the camera utilizes a rechargeable battery, so you can charge it on trips when you have a break and you don't have to be constantly carrying a set of AAs. The picture quality itself is high, in my personal opinion, really good for the price that you're paying and the compactness of the camera. The video quality could be better, but is decent for the size and price of the camera. If you're zooming in a lot, the video quality is obviously compensated, and the audio quality in videos isn't the best, but. You get what you pay for, and in this case, you actually get better. It's well worth the money, providing video-recording abilities and high quality photographs. I highly recommend this camera for anybody looking for a camera for the same purposes as I. It's well worth the money and has exceeded my expectations in performance. It would also be a great starter camera for someone looking for a simple point-and-shoot camera, or for adolescents looking to get into the camera/photography community. Obviously if you're a professional photographer, I wouldn't recommend this camera, but I doubt anybody professional is looking to take high-quality, professional photographs with a simple point-and-shoot camera. For the price, quality, and performance, this camera is well worth the money, and I highly recommend it!(: Read more", "I purchased the Kodak pixPro FZ55 for several reasons: a) I needed a smaller camera that took up less space in my luggage and/or travel backpack; b) used Li-ion rechargeable batteries that could be charged either in the camera or in a small charger; c) took good photos, day or night, of people, buildings, and scenery; d) took good video using 32 or 64 GB SD cards; and e) cost less than $150.00 (for a point and shoot camera!). I received my camera in three working days, opened the box, read the instruction manual, charged the battery (comes partially charged), and put the camera through its paces for a week.  Likes and Dislikes: Look at the comparison photo of my \"normal-sized\" DSLR with carrying strap and regular lens, and the Kodak next to it. Camera fits in my hand. When I travel internationally, usually eight to ten days, I do not use checked luggage; I use only a backpack carry-on that actually fits in the overhead without being offensive to fellow passengers. To do that, the choice in cameras is obvious. Why not just use my cell phone? Because of the increasing number of folks who have lost 'em, dropped 'em, or had 'em stolen. Camera setup using on-screen prompts easy to understand and follow, menu choices easy to ascertain and follow too. Camera takes good photos outdoors as seen in several of the other photos. Zoom (telephoto) capability is average, as seen by the two photos with the white building and vehicles in the distance. Camera doesn't compensate well when too much light is coming in as seen in one photo with bright vegetation and tree shadows, but that can be adjusted with better technique and composition. Macro photos tend to be \"flat\", as seen in one photo, but I expected that without f-stop adjustments or using a tripod. Again, use of better technique would probably help. Also need to think about space and weight in the travel bag.  Zoom is smooth with normal low buzzing sound found in higher-priced point and shoot cameras. LCD screen is small, but I expected that because of the overall smallness of the camera. For me, I can still see the screen image fine. Indoor photos with flash are passable, but one must be close to subject due to reduced flash output. Flash turns \"on\" and \"off\" easily. Timer works well, 2s &10s delay with audible beep when ready to shoot. Use caution and a careful touch when opening the camera to insert or retrieve SD card and/or battery located in same slot, and check that camera is OFF when trying to access the port, located on the bottom corner.

Be sure you allow yourself a little extra time before moving the camera. The photos are pretty good/sharp/clear. I have not printed any. I would have preferred a written book of instructions as opposed to a downloaded version. I'm not sure that this camera is any better than the cheaper \"kid\" cameras. I went with it because of the brand name. It is good for nonprofessional results, a starter camera, or to use until you decide if you want a better camera or a phone with an amazing camera built in. I have used it to take oddball photos of things that most people would not notice and it has worked ok for those. Again, the lag in pressing the button and taking the picture is a bit annoying. Make sure when you order any accessories that they are for this model.", "Great simple point and click camera. Pictures is of good quality.

I took the same picture with my old Sony Cybershot and this camera, and the picture from this camera was somehow both pixelated and fuzzy.

Even though I'm not a professional photographer, I want pictures of family vacations to look halfway decent and this does not do that. I think that I got better pictures with an iPhone 6.

But there are some things that could be improved:  1. The need for a subscription after some time was not clearly described in the listing. The camera still works and records to the SD memory, but after a few weeks, it won't allow you to remotely playback recorded video accessed through notifications.  2. Motion detection could be refined, as I sometimes receive a notification even when turning on a light. I'm unsure if this is intended, but it's unsettling to get a motion detection notification when simply turning on room lights.  3. Night vision is quite good, but it would be nice to have an option to adjust its intensity, similar to how you adjust the settings when taking a picture with your phone. Initially placed in front of a window, when night came, the night vision activated the IR LEDs, revealing nothing more than its reflection.

Not very detail over 4 mts (3.3 ft) but I guess this is not the purpose of these cameras.  Setting up the camera are kinda problematic due to some steps that aren't very clear (maybe it was my smartphone that is 3 years old) but to pair the camera to your WiFi network the app creates a secondary WiFi signal and my phone did not change automatically to the latter network. I did not realize of this step (my mistake) and wasted almost an hour trying to figure out why the camera could not connect to my WiFi. Besides that problem and some minor privacy settings that are weird, the camera works just fine. They record and notifies quite fast of any movement or activity in their surroundings.  Sound quality is not something to praise but is functional, as well as the mic (yes, one can have a conversation with a person in the other end). Function wise, there are nice settings like turning off the red dot, framing specific parts of the room to quickly turn the camera to frame that specific place, automatic detection, turn on/off the alarm, face detection and so on. Feature-wise is very complete.  One downside might be the storage. If you don't buy the cloud service or do not have an SD, the camera will not record any activity by itself. It will still notifies you about any movement but It will be not possible to see what had happened. So at least get a 64GB SD card if you are not interested in cloud storage.

This camera offers top-notch security features, making it a valuable addition to any home.  The 2K 3MP resolution delivers clear footage, surpassing the quality of my old FHD wifi cameras. The color night vision also works well, providing reliable visibility in low-light conditions.  The inclusion of a spotlight and siren alarm adds an extra layer of security, enhancing the overall protective capabilities of the camera. The detection software is significantly better than that of my old cameras; it doesn't generate alarms when the wind moves plants, which used to be quite annoying.  The two-way audio function works seamlessly, and the sound captured by the camera's microphone is of excellent quality.  A standout feature is its wireless, battery-powered design, eliminating the need for complicated installations and messy wiring. After two weeks of use, the camera's battery is holding up well, and it seems that with one charge, it can endure more than two months.  This camera is user-friendly, and the setup process was remarkably fast and simple.

This camera however has been in energy saving mode for over two weeks and still has not required a charge. I can live stream any time from anywhere that has WiFi. The quality was better then expected both in video and audio. There is a light, great quick reacting motion detector,siren, and it takes good photos.

PROs: -- Good quality pictures -- Setup is relatively easy -- Solar panel means I don't ever have to change battery again! -- Ability to record into SD card so I don't have to pay a separate monthly cloud storage fee  CONs: -- I cannot figure out in the app how to record more than 6s. Despite having options to record in different length, all my clips are 6 seconds long. -- Motion detection is not the best once it goes beyond 15 feet or so. Not a super big problem for me as my cameras are mounted directly over an entrance way. But for someone wanting the camera to detect motion over a larger area, it could be a problem  All in all, I can't fault it of some of the imperfections given the price point of the camera.

I also like you can move it with your phone, talk through it, set an alarm sound to get attention, sees clearly at night.", "After using the SimpliSafe monitoring system in my home for years, I decided to take a chance on Amazon-purchased cameras for the first time. I was mainly in the market for a couple of cameras to be able to \"keep an eye\" on an elderly person. When I started my search on Amazon, these cameras were among the first to populate. After reading a few positive and negative reviews, I decided to pull the trigger and purchase them. They have turned out to be a great investment so far. Here are some of the pros and cons I noticed so far.  Packaging and Installation: The box they came in is sturdy and neatly organized. The cameras are straightforward to install, and the instructions are simple. It is unlikely to have any issues assembling these, even if you have little to no experience setting up cameras or with technology in general.  Functionality and Performance: The cameras work splendidly when there is plenty of day or artificial light. The view is, for the most part, crisp and well-defined. Likewise, the picture quality with the night vision is decent. However, if the cameras are too close to a light source when the room is dark, they will likely reflect the circuit board where the lens is mounted. This isn't a huge deal as you can still see clearly most things around it. However, it is somewhat annoying. Although, now and then, it takes a while for it to respond, I like the feature that allows you to rotate the position of the lens 360 degrees right from your phone. This feature mimics that of a joystick in a video game controller. It is possible that the lag is due to issues with the internet connection. The devices also allow you to take stills and videos, which are saved directly to your phone. It is worth noting that the company also offers a cloud storage service for an additional fee. They also come with a microphone to communicate through the camera. I love this feature as it allows me to control Alexa remotely to turn on TVs, shut off lights, play music, turn on the news, etc.  It would be ideal if the company would develop a way to access these devices through your computer in addition to your phone. But all in all, these cameras are an excellent choice if you are not looking to spend much money on complicated monitoring systems. I recommend it.

I got this to watch my 2 week old kittens but my 3 month olds helped me set it up \ud83d\ude09 the video quality is very good. Even at night.  1. You don't need to pay for cloud service 2. You can save videos and take screenshots with the app. (Add SD card if you want) 3. If you don't pay for cloud you can only view auto saved motion alerts for 2 days (you can still see thrumbnail but can't play after 2 days). Cloud allows 7 days. 4. There is a delay on motion alerts but it's only 30-60 seconds. Plus another 60 secs for camera to connect so you can view. Even though i always have it hooked up it has to reconnect every time i open app. So if your like me and need to run into the room that's the only issue. 5. Set up was super easy. 6. It only records about 3-7 seconds when motion is detected. It will stop recording even if there is still movement. Says it will record longer clips if you pay for cloud. 7. Tried the \"only alert in certain section of camera view\" It didn't work for me but I'm recording a cat not a person but Sometimes the camera alerts me saying the cat is a person. 8. Read comment about Siren. It can be turned off. Maybe the person just didn't know how. (Click siren select off and select triggered by motion. If you only select off it will still go off with motion) 9. Another review stated there was no way to turn camera of without unplugging. Which can be done in settings, you can even put camera on schedule. Pic of on/off button on screen view. It wasn't there the first week but I moved camera and it just magically appeared on the screen. Maybe it's a glitch.  Overall great camera for the price.

I now use the HD (1080P) setting full time and only rarely get the \"Poor Network\" message, but I do still get it.  Update July 2, 2020: 1. Make certain battery is charged to 100% before you use it, I can't stress this enough. 2. Unless you don't care if you can use the 1080P video you paid for, have this camera as close to your very powerful router as you can get or it will force you to use :Fluent: which is kind of blurry. I have tried everything I can think of and even though my camera is only about 15 feet from my very expensive Range Extender )Linksys RE7000 *) I can't get it to run 1080P successfully. It keeps telling me that my network is flaky. Anyway, I really like all the other aspects of this camera. It seems very stabile and provides a very wide image and, at 1080P it has a very clear image. Even though ReoLink recommends against it I am going to try a different antenna. The one the ship is only 2dBi gain which is ok in normal circumstances but I guess my circumstances aren't normal.. I found one on Amazon (where else?) that was designed to work with Security Cameras and is 5dBi gain and maybe longer. I know it can't damage the camera and I feel it could help me in this situation. I will come back here to update this review either way.  * This is a different one from the one I talk about below =================================================================================== Update June 26, 2020: I finally have one gripe, sorry.. I actually went out and bought a good Wi-Fi extender, to see if it would solve the apparent bandwidth problem even though my iPhone was seeing max bars a the install location the camera would present the \"Due to poor Wi-Fi reception it is suggested that you use \"Fluid\" resolution (whatever that is) instead of 1080P\". Sorry to say it didn't help. I am presently working with Reolink support to resolve this hopefully. Having said all that I still feel this is a great product  Update June 15, liking it more all the time. Reolink customer service has indicated a willingness to listen to some of our suggestions, perhaps even implementing some of them, of course I won't hold my breath.  On a more positive note:  1. The battery hasn't dropped lower than 82% that I know of, maybe at night, however. Of course we have had a load of the big yellow light in the sky known as the sun. Can hardly wait until next week when we get a week or so of rain.  2. False triggering of alarms remains low, except for the one very windy day we had, when I got a bunch  Update June 14, 2020:  1. Finally got email alerts to work. During the setup process you need to input the port used by your email server, in my case Outlook. The number suggested by the setup process is wrong you need to use port 587. However, if you get a lot of false detections you are going to get a lot of emails. I turned this feature off.  2. As for the windows client problem, my advice is to read the user guide provided. You need to use the camera's UID not the IP address.  I finally did heard from Reolink service and they seem to want to be very helpful. They told me that the phone number I contacted is a scam. They don't charge for in warranty and sometimes, out of warranty service. The say they are looking into some of the problems:  1. Having to renew the \"free\" cloud subscription every month 2. The inability to delete images/videos from the SD card  I consistently have been getting 4 bars of 2.4g WiFi yet sometimes I have trouble connecting in the app. Yesterday I was in my car in the driveway the app told me I was using cellular when I clearly had a strong WiFi connection on my iPhone 6s =========================================================== Original post:  Installed yesterday, first what I like, it is easier:  1. Image is acceptable. 2. Alerts aren't too bad, yet 3. Same with night vision 4, Hardware and camera are first rate. I totally disagree with negative comments about the Solar Panel mounting arm. I couldn't get the locking screw hole in the camera mount to line up with the screw so I left it out. Unless we have an earthquake or tornado I don't see the camera coming loose 5. The Solar Panel seems to do a great job keeping the battery topped off.  Now on to what I don't like:  1. Setup is NOT easy, for some reason you need to be within a couple of feet for it to connect to the router. I must have gone thru setup a dozen times. 2. Installation was NOT a breeze, see also number 4 above 3. Support from the company is basically non-existent. i contacted their Support number only to be told that I would have to pay $50 for the support I needed 4 Setting up email alerts is difficult I never did get it to work 5. Support documentation is almost non-existent. I guess this is to be expected when you consider number 3 above 6. The \"free\" cloud must be renewed each month, once a year or lifetime of camera, would be more appropriate 7. I don't like the fact that you can't erase individual videos from he Micro SD Card. In order to get rid of they you need to format the card which forces a reboot. Yet they let you erase individual or all videos in the cloud, an oversight perhaps 8. I never got the Windows client to hook to my camera How do I know who the user is and what password is needed?  When all is said and done, however, I feel this camera is one of the best on the market at this price point. Maybe that doesn't say much about the competition, however.  I am hoping the company sees this review Read more", "Though I live in a safe neighborhood in a safe town, no one is immune to unsafe circumstances. I finally decided to buy a Reolink camera after quite some time and lots of research, and chose the Argus Eco+ for what it offers.  1. It charges via solar power! Sure it needs an initial charge out of the box, but it's been charging with no issues where I've placed the camera and the solar panel.  2. It has motion detection! Where I have mounted my camera leaves a bit to be desired in terms of sensitivity, though it captures and records as it should. There is about a 3 second delay when the camera activates and starts recording, so it may have more to do with where I've mounted it that the camera itself.  3. It's able to see at night! Where I live there's about 5 or 6 feral cats, and they prefer to go through my yard and no one elses, so... the PIR motion detection picks works very well! They can be clearly seen, even with the camera in night vision mode.  4. The app is straightforward enough for most to understand! I had a few hiccups figuring out the Reolink app at first, as the in-box leaflet is little help. It works as it should, and I have not experienced any major issues with the camera losing connection. However, the app sometimes doesn't play nice on my phone, running Andriod 12 (it's usually when I get a motion alert and go to look at the feed and it says 'failed to load feed. Tap to retry.' and usually takes 3 tries before it cooperates.) On my Andriod tablet running Android 13/One UI 5.1? Runs like a dream. So... I firmly believe it's my phone and not the camera. Read more", "I wish I could give 5 stars! I first purchased this camera a year and a half ago. Between my husband and I we have added 3 more to our property since then. They are simple enough and work great! Until now. We recently had a big storm and had to replace our internet modem. This required reconfiguring all cameras to the new network. 2 of our cameras reset with no issues. 1 camera got water inside somehow, and this my oldest camera that has never moved and never gotten moisture inside before. With moisture inside the lens (pictured) the image would get very foggy also constantly record due to ongoing motion triggering, and the battery wouldn't fully charge. Immediately upon reaching out for support and providing the order number from so long ago a new camera was on it's way at no cost to me!! And the 4th camera did not want to reset for me. I fought with this camera and charged it inside and turned it off and on and pressed the reset button 100x it does work but not without being stubborn. I reset the network finally and put it back in its place outside only to find that the wifi no longer picks up out there. Camera issue? Or possibly new network issue? Regardless I tried resetting it again to connect to a wifi extender and the same stubborn issue happened again. I had been talking back and forth with tech support during this whole ordeal. They were helpful apart from having the weekend off work. But again, immediately upon determining this camera is malfunctioning they sent a new one to replace it. It's still in the mail but no issues with there first replacement. All issues could have been caused by this freak storm. That is why we had to replace our modem in the first place. But I have been completely satisfied otherwise. Would recommend and would purchase again!! With a disclaimer. But thanks to their amazing tech support I have nothing negative to say.

This camera seems to be tailored for those just starting in the field, offering a budget-friendly option that helps build a foundation of camera knowledge.  One aspect that stands out is its user-friendly design. Navigating through the settings and controls is relatively straightforward, making it an excellent choice for beginners who might be overwhelmed by more advanced options. The camera's compact size also adds to its convenience, making it easy to carry around and capture moments on the go.  However, I must admit that the image and video quality did not meet my initial expectations. While the camera performs reasonably well, especially considering its affordable price point, there is a noticeable difference in quality compared to more high-end models. This is particularly evident when shooting in low-light conditions, where the images tended to lack the crispness and clarity I was hoping for.  Upon seeking advice from other users, one common suggestion was to invest in an external light to mount on the camera. Taking this advice into consideration, I found that using additional lighting significantly improved the overall quality of both my photos and videos. It seems that the camera's performance benefits from external accessories, and this is something potential buyers may want to keep in mind.  I noticed a marked improvement in the camera's performance when shooting outdoors. The natural lighting conditions contributed to better image and video quality, showcasing the camera's potential when used in optimal environments. This suggests that the camera is well-suited for outdoor photography and videography, making it a suitable choice for capturing moments in well-lit settings.  In conclusion,VETEK Digital Cameras is a commendable entry-level camera for individuals venturing into the realms of photography and videography. While it may not deliver the highest quality results in all situations, it serves as an excellent starting point for beginners to hone their skills. Investing in additional accessories, such as external lighting, can enhance the overall performance of the camera and make it a more versatile tool for creative expression. If you're on a budget and looking to build a solid foundation in camera knowledge, this camera is a worthy contender.

I currently use stationary cameras placed throughout the home to keep an eye on it while they are away. The cameras are up-to-date with night vision capability, motion & sound detection, and 3 K resolution, but because they are stationary, I have to place them just right to get a panoramic view of the rooms they are in and sometimes it's hard to get everything I want into the frame. With this pan/tilt camera, it's no longer an issue.  Build: The build quality of this camera is excellent. It has a good weight to it and a sturdy base with non-slip pads, so it won't fall over or get knocked over easily. The plastic used is a high quality plastic and the camera tilts and pans smoothly and quickly without issue. The power cable is quite long (6 ft) and it uses a USB-C connection.  Software: I downloaded the app from Google Play Store and was pleasantly surprised. The camera was easy to setup via the app and the app itself is easy to use with the camera controls streamlined and intuitive. The camera is ready to use right away with the app, but the app also provides a variety of settings that you can tinker with and personalize if you so choose. Motion detection and sound detection work well and sensitivity can be adjusted. The siren function and speaker function are clear and loud when needed.  Image Quality: Image quality is excellent during the day and night. Zooming causes some distortion as is to be expected, but colors are natural and crisp and images are sharp. Image quality is perfect for security camera use.  Overall: I'm quite happy with my selection and have added it to the overall security system for my parents' house. The pan/tilt function was something I really wanted and this camera does not disappoint. I will consider getting additional units in the future as needed.

I\u2019m not a photographer, but I knew with the right roll of film I could get the look I was wanting. Anyhow, I checked out the reviews for this camera and the film suggestions, some reviews included pictures of their developed photos and they looked great. I confidently made my purchase! I feel like you can\u2019t go wrong on the camera itself, just do your research on the film. The camera is plastic essentially, so it\u2019s light weight, that doesn\u2019t bother me very much though. It does have a flash and installing the film was super easy. Also make sure you know of a place that developes film!  Overall the quality is little less than desired, but still a great purchase for me! It\u2019s way cheaper than investing in a fancy schmancy camera and lens when photography isn\u2019t even a hobby of mine lol.

After opening my package I had put in a fresh battery and within two months of having it, I noticed the flash wasn\u2019t turning on. I had only used it up to 50 shots. I changed out the battery and it started to work so I guess I\u2019ll be going through my batteries more often than expected. Other than that the camera has held up and it super lightweight and would be a cute gift for someone starting out with photography or just a cute little camera to have for fun!", "I'm still relatively new to film photography but, I can confidently say that this camera is very nice to have. I personally just wanted a film camera with the quality of disposables, and this is absolutely perfect.  BUILD QUALITY Now as you could guess, the camera itself doesn't have a great build quality, it's pretty much plastic, which wasn't an issue for me, but I know could turn off some buyers to it. The leather and the part above it feel nice to the touch though. One small complaint I do have though is that the battery compartment is a bit sensitive and just grazing it could open it. But I solved the issue by slightly changing where I put my left thumb on the camera.  FLASH The flash itself needs a AAA battery and works great. It's very bright and gets the job done for painting the subjects in the dark from about six feet away I'd say. To turn on the flash, you sort of have to spin the border around the lens, there's a spot to grab on to for your nail right at the top, to make it easy. It's also pretty much impossible to turn the flash on and off by accident.  LOADING/UNLOADING Loading the film is very easy on this, as you just pretty much put it in there and wind it up until you hear that first click. SUPER IMPORTANT, when unloading, don't forget to click down the rewind button near the battery compartment before unwinding the film. If it unclicks itself during the process, just press it again then it should stay for sure.  VIEWFINDER/EXPOSURE COUNT The biggest issue that I have with this camera is the exposure count, as it is more difficult to view than other cameras. I'm not sure why they made it that way, but it is what it is. I don't really worry about it as I have 36 exposure rolls I use (which turn to 72) and always have a spare with me. The viewfinder has little meshlike blocks on the left and right sides, to show what will be taken out of the shot.  SHOOTING TIPS I got my film back and it is safe to say that this thing performs really well outdoors on a sunny day. I like the softness and the grain on the images I got back. One note that I will add, is to ALWAYS use flash indoors unless there is a good amount of natural sunlight and use flash when it's not sunny outside. Even if it's light out, if it isn't bright, use flash if capturing subjects. I included an example of what it looks like when you shot in low light without flash (I was using a roll of Kodacolor Ultra Max 400).  CLOSING REMARKS I think this is an excellent camera for the price and if you want an alternative to disposables. It's really easy to just pass the camera to a friend who is inexperienced with this camera, as it's pretty much wind, point, and shoot.

I would recommend to anyone wanting to try film photography without breaking the bank", "I bought this camera in July 2024 to us when traveling. I really loved the design and the half frame which allowed me to take double the photos as I normally would. This definitely reduces the ability to capture full photos (you\u2019d need to back up quite far to get larger groups of people) but it honestly wasn\u2019t a huge issue.  I\u2019ve shot about 3 rolls since getting this camera so about 216 photos. Photos turned out great, but the scrolling wheel completely broke the last time I used it. It won\u2019t move forward or backwards and the little film stop button under it is also jammed. Without the scroll wheel working, I can\u2019t even load a new roll of film in. I\u2019m pretty bummed because I love this camera but in the end it wasn\u2019t worth the money for only 6 months of moderate use.", "This is a very cheap-feeling chunk of plastic. The style is a nifty-looking throwback but the quality of the build is barely above single-use disposable film cameras. Certainly the quality doesn't justify a price $35-$50 (at the time of purchase Sept. 2023, depending on the model).  The half-frame photos are a great idea to eke the most out of expensive 35mm film + processing.  As a fixed-focus camera, nothing is ever really in crisp focus. Also there is a significant tilt-shift look to every photo. The center is focused but the periphery is blurred. This is kind of a problem for a photographer who would prefer a focused image with the option to add effects later, either in optical printing or after scanning.  If you are okay with a camera with a licensed-out Kodak brand on it but with none of the original Kodak build heft or quality, then this might be a fun, novel camera for you.", "Make sure to use flash when you don\u2019t have a bunch of natural light. This camera works great when you give it the right ingredients to succeed. Produces fun pictures and the 72 picture film count per roll is a very nice perk.", "I've gone through my fair share of point-and-shoot cameras and this one has been the best by far. While it is made of plastic and therefore feels a bit cheap, it still does the trick and has lasted longer than any of my other plastic cameras.

AI Human Auto Tracking? Yeah sure, LOL  The biggest issue is connectivity. I even bought a wifi extender and have it 10ft from the cameras and they STILL hardly ever connect when using the app.  Did someone ring your doorbell? Did you hear a loud crash outside? A gunshot? Need to check the camera quickly to see what's going on outside? Good luck! You MIGHT be able to get live view going after a few minutes of trying to re-connect but by that time whatever's going on outside has probably passed. Need to check prior recordings? Get ready for some serious frustration that in most cases leads to not being able to view a SINGLE recording on the app because they will all just spin out and not connect.  I'm an IT person and am no stranger to Wifi cameras. I've tried troubleshooting these, reset them, moved antennas around, reconnected to wifi, purchased an additional wifi extender, etc. These cameras are just awful (or it's just the app, but since it's required, it in return makes the cameras garbage too!).

I dislike that if you change the password for your home internet you would have to take down all the cameras and reset and reconnect back. The cameras are extremely difficult to watch live and recorded streams on the app even though I have 200Mb broadband speed. Many times the display would keep spinning around trying to connect to the server until it gives up. The image quality is okay. Installation is not that hard. Just bring all cameras near your router and connect to your internet using the app on your phone. Then take them and install around your residence. The value for money is good. The cameras look well made and durable. The customer service is very good. If it could only connect to the app quickly as other manufacturer's cameras that I have it would have been so good. Now concerning night vision all my cameras, from three different companies, are more or less the same- if the subject comes 15-20 feet it would be probably be possible to make an identification but further and the subject gets a little difficult to make out. Day time pics are good.

I purchased this camera while it was on sale, and after some underwhelming experiences with other cameras around this price-point, I wasn't sure if this one would be good. But it is an excellent camera, with great picture quality! The 2k resolution provides a nice improvement over a 1080p camera.  Good things about the camera: - Good night vision/IR - Pan function - Intercom (microphone and speaker) function through the app - CloudEdge app works well - MicroSD card slot for recording, not forced to pay for a cloud service. - DC Barrel power plug (more durable than USB, and easier to extend over long distances)  One of the best features is that this camera supports ONVIF/RTSP. You just have to enable it using the app, and then you can connect the camera to a standard NVR or other software that supports ONVIF. I'm using it with Synology Surveillance Station and it's working great.  When I first bought the camera, the panning control didn't work from Surveillance Station/using ONVIF. I emailed Dekco and they replied to me and had a firmware update ready in less than 24 hours! After installing the firmware update with the app and reconnecting the camera, the panning control worked. Their customer support is AMAZING!  Since purchasing this camera, I've bought 3 more Dekco cameras (a 2K Pan/Tilt DC5E, and two 5MP Pan/Tilt DC5P). I've been equally (or more) impressed with these other cameras and can definitely recommend any of these models (DC4L, DC5E, DC5P) or likely any other camera from Dekco.  If you can afford the extra money, I would suggest either pan/tilt models (DC5P/DC5E) - it's a little more versatile having the ability to pan left/right and tilt up/down, instead of just panning. But you can't go wrong with the DC4L if you don't need the tilt feature. Read more", "Good quality cameras. Nice and clear image.

I needed one for the new shed in my backyard. So after searching, looking, and researching, I came across this one and decided to try it. It wasn't too expensive so I figured I'd return it if it didn't work. I have had negative experiences with little solar panels charging cameras in the past so I didn't set it up with the panel, only the internal battery, which I assumed with my dogs running around, people in the neighboring apartments walking around, and us in the yard, I'd be happy if the battery lasted a week. But I truly didn't expect it to make it past three days. Silly me! It has been a week now (five days) and the camera is still functioning perfectly. The app is telling me the camera is at 100%. I can't believe that, but it is still going so maybe it is. This one has amazed me. I also have a thirty foot micro usb cable that I was going to run through the shed wall to power it, but it has proved to be true to its name: \"Smart battery camera.\" I installed a 128gb samsung SD card. Works great! Weather has not effected it at all. The night vision is better than expected for the price I paid. The app is simple yet highly functional. It was very easy to mount and the solar panel would have been as well. The seals to keep out the moisture are snug and sturdy, not loose and floppy. This thing is sweet! I will be ordering more. I hugjly recommend this to anybody who needs a wireless camera.", "Simply a product that meets expectations and goes beyond. It has amazing image quality and is very easy to install.

The app is also very simple to use and intuitive, and sharing camera access with your family is also very simple and fast.", "I placed my Poyasilon solar-powered camera beneath my porch eaves above my front door a month ago. So far, I've been very pleased with its ability to sense and clearly record all significant movements on my driveway and at my front door.  Before deploying the camera, I was a bit concerned the solar panel might not be able to power it because I live in a wooded area, the front of my house faces north, and I would have to place the solar panel were it is not exposed to any direct sunlight. I've been very pleasantly surprised that the battery strength indicator has never dipped below ~90% and the panel is more than sufficient to keep this wireless camera operating.  I've used many different security cameras, indoors and out, over the last two decades and this one in comparison (particularly at its very reasonable price) is remarkably easy to use, suited to the task, and reliable.  Aside from seeing myself and people making deliveries, I was fascinated to see a large raccoon on his midnight rounds, climbing down my porch post from the roof and strolling across the driveway to check out my trash bin. He/she must live in a tree overhanging the roof of my house. I'm reminded I need to prune some branches, but my 'neighbor' will be able to climb to the ground down the tree trunk as nature intended.  I delete the recordings from the sd card daily -- but I saved the raccoon recordings to show the other nature lovers.  So far, so good... if that changes, I'll update.

One, I don't mount anything on my exterior walls...they are stucco, and I think it weakens it to drill holes in it. Two, I don't want to hard wire anything or have to keep recharging it. Well, this camera solved both problems. I live where it snows, so as shown in the photos, I mounted the solar panel so it's almost vertical, and not at the recommended tilt angle. I also don't want snow building up on the mounting, so only the panel is exposed. The rest of the mount is attached to the soffit. No snow builds up on the panel. Same thing with the camera. I couldn't mount it where I wanted on the exterior of my trim due to the rain gutter, and I didn't want snow to build up on it, so I figured out how to mount it under the overhang. It works great there, and the camera is well protected.  Pros - Very simple to install...straightforward instructions, even includes drilling templates if you need them. Setting up the app couldn't have been easier, took me about 5 minutes. Excellent picture quality, includes a zoom feature which I didn't know it had. The pan/tilt feature is really nice...I can look at my front porch then pan around and clearly see my fence/gate which is 200 feet away.  Cons - Not really a con, but if you don't want (or can't) mount it flat on a wall, you'll have to fabricate a mount of some sort, as I did. I say it's not really a con because they can't be expected to anticipate every possible mounting scenario, and they do provide screws and screw anchors for standard mounting. I found nothing I would consider a con in regard to the use of the camera and the app.  Customer Service - Excellent. I was concerned that my solar panel didn't seem to be charging the camera, so I emailed Anran. They got back to me in a couple of hours, and had suggestions to help me. I described what I did to set it up and they were very patient with my multiple emails. Problem solved and everything works fine now. And it wasn't a defect issue, just a minor adjustment with the cable.  I now have two of these. Couldn't be happier, and I'll probably buy some more for gifts to neighbors and other friends.

Slide the camera on the rail and it clicks in place. 3 more drywall screws to fasten the detachable solar base to the fascia on the west side of my house around the corner. Then hand screw on the solar panel and adjust. Hand tighten nut. Done. Cord from panel to camera is plenty long. Maybe 6-8 feet. I used about a foot. Ziptied and tucked the rest. Everything seemed sturdy enough for high winds. There are a lot of features on this camera. Install the app on your phone. It operates them well. It displays wifi strength percentage and battery power percentage realtime. My camera gets about 75-80% approximately 50 feet away from the router thru the garage on an Xfinity router. More than I expected. Battery life seems more than adequate with the included solar panel. But we've had full sun so I'll watch that. The camera has numerous features. It has an optional siren. With a warning on the app stating it may annoy your neighbors. I don't use that. And haven't heard it. It has 2 regular lights which will illuminate a small area if you choose to use that option. Turn on/off with the light button on app. There is night vision B/W and night vision color which uses different lights. I use b/w. The picture quality is fine. I don't need night colors. Overall quality of picture is really good. On the app, you just drag your finger on the screen to rotate the camera. 360 degrees around. Probably 90 degrees vertical from horizon and going straight down. There is a paid AI function which will recognize packages and animals and people and differentiate. I use an SD card for storage. I formatted it on PC using slow format fat 32. Installed in camera. Pressed alerts, and camera prompted to reformat SD card. Took 2 times but then it started functioning. You can set alert zones and all kinds of notifications for everything. The first camera I ordered would not power on. I returned it and the second on powered right up and worked fine. There is an included window security camera sticker.  I'll be happy if I can get at least 2 years out of this camera. I love the idea that it's soler and doesn't add on to the power bill. I like the Fullscreen option on the phone/ipad. Also to add a second phone/iPad to view the camera, you have to add a 'family member' to your 'family' it's kind of convoluted but I got it to work reliably. It takes a while to set it up and dial it in, but it's worth it. I'd recommend the purchase. I will update as necessary *UPDATE It appears the plastic cover over the camera lens has turned cloudy around the outside. The picture is blurred. I've cleaned the lens several times with a microfiber cloth and even tried light Windex on the cloth. Nothing is changing. Used to be perfectly clear. Haven't had the camera very long. Hopefully it will not continue to cloud to the point of unusability. Will keep you posted. 2nd UPDATE 1-7-23 Lens has cleared up. Don't know how or why but the picture quality is back to normal.

And I was looking to buy another one from Amazon for my backyard, I came across with this Anran wireless camera. It has the same quality picture of 5MP, PTZ, solar powered, same CloudEdge apps program from my front yard camera, it can also be linked to Alexa and above all it has a lot better price. So when I received it, I immediately added it to Cloudedge apps and the programming was seamless (internet 2G). I didn't have to call support unlike the first one that I made numerous phone calls for support to get it working. When I was 300 miles away from home, the Anran camera is still active monitoring my backyard. Bottom line, this camera is excellent if you are looking for the same features that I outlined above.", "Very pleases with this security camera. Set up was fast and easy. Camera covers a good area.

I also bought a memory chip to save some clips. I bought mine to keep an eye on our teen when we're out. I have paid for the yearly service for one camera, but not the 2nd one. I recommend and feel it's worth the $$.", "Do you need a camera to monitor part of the house, the garage, the pets? Do you have a plug nearby? Then this camera is great. It's not the highest res, but 1080P is very clear and does a good job with night vision even though there are not a lot of IR lights around it. It has a decent amount of rotation and tilt to be able to monitor a pretty wide area.  Setup, was a little quirky. you first connect your phone to the cameras wifi. Then you set the camera to detect the home wifi router, putting in the 2.4ghz password. If that completes, you're pretty much on your way. If not, you have to repeat this step a couple of times, which happened to me. At first i wasn't too sure of the setup routine as it wouldn't complete the setup. Another irritation is, it will say your microsd car isn't useable. You need to use the tapo app to format the sd card once the phone app and camera are setup, and it should be fine. The phone app lets you take a picture, lets you record and stop recording. What i dont know yet, is it recording per schedule, or recording when you hit the record button while viewing? I will have to check into that, but you get a scheduler like most security cams, with normal recording schedule and motion schedule. It comes with a mount bracket to mount on wall or someplace. I just have it on a desk so i can point it down at where my dog sleeps. You can pan it around and the 1080p picture is clear in daylight and infrared at night. If the setup worked a little better i'd give this 5 stars because the price is great.  So if you need a small camera, that you can just place somewhere in the house in range of your 2.4ghz router, this works and was somewhat easy to set up. 4stars for now, but 5 star price.  i'm updating review since i just bought my 3rd tapo camera. So connection setup must have been fixed somewhat as i was able to set up on first try. It's still the same though as i mentioned above. What i didn't mention, is that there is a normal recording schedule which records continuously and a motion recoring schedule which only records when it detects movement. So when you go to play back you will only see snippets of recording if you only selected motion. They added a lot of features which requires some sort of subscription, like i do not use cloud, i dont like my home being stored online. I dont use advanced (subscribed) features like they can send you emails with snapshot for different triggers (movement, person, baby) but you will pay for this email service. It does have notifications though for free and it is just a text msg saying a detection happened, which is good enough for me. Also with other cameras you can filter sections of the screen out, that it wont trigger a notification. This works well unless you follow mode which the camera will try to follow the movement and then the filtered section will now filter areas you didn't want to. So take that into consideration. Still giving this a 5 for the price of the camera. Read more", "I got this camera to keep an eye on my cats when I'm out of town. I had a great opportunity to test it out when took a week long trip abroad. It worked perfectly! The night vision was actually really cool because of the time difference. Half the time I checked in to see if the cats were around, it was night time, so I was still able to see them. It has a pretty good range of motion. It allowed me to see almost the entire room that I set the camera in. And for my favorite feature, the voice function. I happened to catch a moment where I could see my cat planning to jump on the counters (which they're not allowed to do), and I used the microphone (keep in mind, I was in London and the cats were in Idaho, US) and I told the cat no, just like I would if I were home. He looked around to figure out where the voice came from and then thought about jumping up again, so I yelled again and he turned around and left the area!

So we went with this model, based on the price we paid in the US for KASA. The camera came on time and as advertised. Thes TAPO cameras are obviously made by the same company as KASA, they look exactly the same the only difference is that you need to download the TAPO app. The camera is easy to install, and once the app is loaded onto your phone, it takes a couple of minutes to connect. The picture quality is great, it works EXACTLY like the KASA, and interestingly enough, when I opened the TAPO app, my Kasa cameras in Florida appeared there, there's obviously an intuitive feature built into the app! I dont even need to go to my KASA app. to view my cameras in my Florida home, there. This TAPO camera is very good with a high quality picture, the only issue is that on the app, there is no opportunity for shutting down SPECIFIC notifications, such as people movement, noise, etc. so unless you go into the settings on your phone to shut down ALL notifications, you will get one movement notification after another on your phone.

The camera supports up to 128GB - Comes with 2 battery included - Detailed instruction manual included for reference - Warranty provided by the manufacturer  Cons: - I wish there was a carrying case included in the bundle too - I wish they bundled 64 or 128 GB card in the pack since 32GB would fill so soon when videos at high resolution are shot Read more", "The box comes with a card, batteries, and all the cables.

The controls are not difficult and the ability to download all photos and videos to your computer can allow you to have some fun if you have a video editor. The instruction booklet was acceptable but it did identify all functions and locations, a few things I had to figure out myself so unless you have really smart kids (and they might be smarter than you with this) you might want to familiarize yourself with its operation so you know how to get the pictures out and maybe reset the settings if one of them gets into the settings and messes anything up.  NOTE: The fact they included 2 batteries so you should never run out of power when you are out on a trip or something is a real bonus over others.  I didn't fully understand how to use this little camera, how hard could this be, I finally understood what to do, it does help when you read the instruction booklet. So I tried to put the battery in, it would not go in, so I took a closer look at the opening where the battery does go and I noticed a little black notch (it is also keyed to prevent inserting it the wrong way), I held the notch down with one finger and pushed the battery in, it went in and then I proceeded to turn the camera on, It Worked!!! WoW! I was really excited! then I remembered I needed to get a memory card for it, but it turns out they gave me a memory card (32 Gig) This little gem of a camera takes beautiful, clear pictures and video...I'm really glad that I bought this!! :)  Bottom Line: It is a camera that would have been professional level before everyone had a phone with a camera built in, it appears sturdy, it comes with a lanyard and a pouch to help keep it from getting laid down and lost plus it takes really good pictures so 5 Stars for a great deal for something a you will love if if you desire to produce really professional looking pictures and video.

This 4K digital camera is a great example of a camera that is affordable, generates high quality videos and photos, and has features that are not available on flagship smartphones. This camera is especially great for younger kids who do not need a smartphone.

The camera's compact size is also a plus, making it effortless to carry during hikes without the need for a backpack. Additionally, I appreciate that it is versatile in low-light settings, as flash is not always practical in shaded wooded areas where I often take pictures. I have even managed to capture macros of plants in the woods that were previously challenging to capture with other cameras. Finally, the camera's built-in wireless capability and USB cable allow for swift and convenient image downloading to a computer, albeit at a slightly slower pace.

I feel like it keeps up with most cameras of higher cost and is superior to anything else at this price point.I'm very new to photography, but was getting some good night shots so far. It's actually better than I thought it would be with those indoors shots under incandescent, fluorescent and LED lighting.I'll be using it for landscapes, nature and taking photos in cities and towns. The photo quality is excellent in my opinion and it works great without being to imposing or cluttered. It turns on in maybe two seconds, so I can stop the bike, be sure of a great picture and be moving again, making great time. Some days I get rained on really good and this camera is a perfect addition to my contingency gear. It should also do well in the colder conditions. It feels durable and I'm sure it will do well if I drop it or if it gets crushed around in my baggage on a tough day.  The firmware on the camera takes a day to learn, with all the little extras embedded in there, but after that navigation is relatively easy. Even though it is I think classified a \"point and shoot\" everything is customizable- and even more so, once you know a couple of tricks that are mentioned online in various places. Most anybody however, can simply pick this up, click it on auto mode and get great pictures without confusion.  I will be enjoying this camera for many years to come I'm sure it's worth it.

Very happy I grab this. It was extremely easy to install. 10/10 recommend and for a fantastic price.", "So, I do security cameras for other folks as part of my job, but I needed an inexpensive, basic camera for inside my own home. This camera does well. Noise and motion detection is good (sometimes too good - it catches reflections real easy!). Yes, you can hear the motor when it turns, so, a little less quality build encasing the motor, but for the price - hey, that's reasonable (so 4 stars). The tracker gets bored quickly and resets to home. There are multiple features on this camera, like the patrol mode and zone monitoring that seem like they might be GREAT features. Frankly, I'm just too lazy to go through all the learning curves to deal with that (and the added features are not overly \"user friendly\" - and if that's the case for me, that means it's not pleasant for the average user, so a bonus, but a waste unless you want to take the time to learn it all). My living room is not large enough to need the full 360deg, and its noise detection can tell if someone's coming from off-screen. It does recognize people (which substituted the patrol mode for me). Great for night vision. Not obnoxious in size. Not intrusive. It's app is pretty basic - just like every other app out there but I DO like NO subscription fees just to \"use\" it (there may be some to store to the cloud?). It may have ads, but I haven't noticed. I did buy my own SD card, got the class 10, 256 GB high fidelity card, and ran this at 2k. Quality was GREAT. I tried 1080. Quality was still amazing. I went down to the 720... and quality was STILL great (but not for face recognition in low light). I'm not looking more than 25 - 30 feet away and the details are MORE than sufficient, giving me even longer record times before it overwrites. It doesn't always alert me on the app when it sees motion, that is touch and go? Maybe a network issue. I did have a 1-time loss of wifi with router at the very beginning, but that remedied itself. (and sometimes, it is slow to connect - but that is all network dependent, not necessarily the camera). Long story short - if someone's breaking into your home, you want to know immediately. You want faces. And, you want to be able to report it. This does that and well enough for the price (in fact, it just beeped at me thru my phone while sitting at work and typing this). Again, it's in the $30 - $40 range... so it's not going to be \"high class\". But, to get to that range, you're \"usually\" jumping into the $200-1200+ per camera category, so... for my tight budget, no. It has some mounting options, nothing fancy (like all others in this price range). It's corded, but you can always find solutions for that (and it's not a hidden cam, so cord doesn't really matter, and no battery powered cam will give you good, constant operations without fast draining). Funny note - it picked up motion on our TV screen while binging Supernatural! As an IT person who does camera set-up security, if you're on a budget, I recommend this. I was going to get a Hiseeu cam because of their quality build, but honestly, the Kasa has audio detection, better audio quality, near the same range of vertical motion, does not have to be mounted up-side down (can sit on its base), is smaller / less obvious, does well at night, does lack the \"emergency lights\" option (unless I'm mistaken, someone please correct me), and has a \"patrol\" mode (which, if you've ever used 360 degree cameras, you suddenly realize that it can't see someone coming from a blind spot and becomes obnoxiously useless without a patrol mode and/or audio detection) - and altogether, even tho the Hiseeu motor is quiet and the build is stronger (and it can pair with an NVR whereas I have no idea if the Kasa can), that STILL makes Kasa the better option for me (on a budget). Read more", "These cameras are excellent! The price paid is minimal compared to the total amount of functionality. They do track objects that trigger them, maybe not as smoothly as higher priced options (I don\u2019t know, have not tried others). For the mobility of relocating the camera by simply picking it up and finding a new location, it\u2019s massively more practical than the full wired systems available. Until you know where you want those more expensive cameras to be permanently installed, these cameras are a great alternative! Also, great for keeping a watch on who\u2019s passing by your place at window-level.  Wired cameras have to be mounted high enough to be safe from getting ripped down by trespassers, these see through windows during the day very well. Interior night vision is top notch, seeing outside through windows at night is more difficult.  With the sensitivity turned up, every time a tree branch blows it triggers the cameras. This leads to near constant triggering of alerts during the late Spring, Summer and early Fall. And, lots of recordings every day. So, you need to use the App to designate areas to watch for motion, or it\u2019ll drive you nuts and frustrate you. To the point that you may start to ignore the notices.  The App provides great control, and allows remote on/off, sensitivity setting changes, you can set to record noise triggers or remove that, set trigger zones, move the camera via the App, and other adjustments. I have noticed that the App actually does offer more functions, and work a little more smoothly, through my phone than my very new tablet. No idea why, it should be the same App for both platforms, no? But, of course watching the playback on the larger screen is so much better, so I do use both.  The service plan allows storage of recordings from up to 10 cameras for $10 per month. Much more cost effective than others I looked into.  The cons: Can\u2019t see thru glass with the built-in lights, at night. Reflection off the glass blinds the camera. That should have been obvious to me from the start, since these are designed for indoor use only. but I had naively hoped for better night vision performance. So, if looking out a window, get a motion-activated light to trigger so you can see what\u2019s going on out there. Just don\u2019t set it up where it will shine in your bedroom and wake you up.  App functionality on phone is higher than on tablet, no idea why. You will want to have the App on at least a phone, if not both.  Sometimes, some cameras will trigger, others won\u2019t, for the same event. Deer moving around the house sometimes are ignored by one camera, recorded by another. Also happened that another outdoor camera from another manufacturer recorded a vehicle trespassing, these cameras didn\u2019t. Had to adjust the sensor sensitivity, but I think the baseline software settings should be set to trigger sooner on vehicles.  Branches moving on the breeze cause constant notices, even with Person Detection Mode activated. A more elaborate software system might offer better monitoring, but for the pro systems, this requires fully wired systems with dedicated main recording components/control systems . Much more expensive, and I can\u2019t afford to open the walls throughout the property.  Overall, these are great! I have bought several models, both the fixed ones and the bigger moving ones. All look great when set to the highest recording resolution, seem to last a long time, and are a breeze to set up or switch from spot to spot. I very much recommend this camera! I also hope the manufacturer can produce a 4K version. Read more", "I installed one of these cameras in my attic to ensure that I don\u2019t get any unwanted rodent guests. Used with the Kasa phone app this is a great monitoring solution. I added an inexpensive micro SD card for recording. You can setup multiple viewing angles to quickly survey the area remotely when required. It will automatically notify your phone when motion is detected and the recording allows to review the activity. Thankfully, so far it has only seen the occasional moth. It has saved me many trips up to the attic and has worked well for many months. I also have many kasa wifi light and outlet switches which also work very well.

I can wave my hand quickly and actually see a few of my fingers still, or have my dog run around in circles and you can still clearly see her! I took a picture with it inside my dim room and it's as clear as my phones camera when I'm outside. I should also mention that since I move around a lot while using it it does auto adjust a lot and it's definitely noticeable but not horribly so.

I am not using it for audio input, so speaking about the audio quality is not making this review. Just note I have a BA in music with a focus in recording techniques and electronic music. The mic will work okay for a basic conversation, but not much more.  I was just disappointed by the field of vision this camera has. My sister and I play on this computer and I think it was meant for a single person to be on camera. The computer is on the other side of a dining room table and we still have to sit close together to get us in view.  The video quality is less than desired.

We live were there are birds and wildlife and love being able to get some nice photos without breaking out the big camera changing lenses and then putting it all away when done. Easy to carry around. Light weight. Overall a great camera for the money. Lots of photo options for different scenarios. Cons: Doesn't have the second button for vertical photo. The lens cap isn't secured in place with a click like my old camera. Therefor the lens cap comes off quite easily so be sure to use the string attachment so you don't lose it.", "I owned a similar Kodak camera many years ago, so I thought this would be a great camera for my trip to Alaska. Wrong. So glad I had my phone camera for a back up. As far as ease of use, sure it was fairly simple to operate. Settings were not too complex to figure out. But the picture quality is just terrible. It wouldn\u2019t focus 90% of the time. I tried and tried to adjust the settings, nothing helped. I finally gave up the hopes of getting any kind of quality picture out of this camera. The Kodak brand did not live up to the standard it once had.", "good product", "Bought this as a first camera for my wife. She loves taking pictures so she\u2019d always take my phone as it has a better camera.

I\u2019ve attached a picture to the review, just look at it, a half-baked potato would\u2019ve done a better job. iPhone 11 photo beside it for comparison.  Perhaps photographers are gonna laugh at me and ask what I expected. But let this be a caution for beginners like me \u2013 save yourself from a headache, don\u2019t buy this camera. Phones probably do a better job at this price point anyways, don\u2019t bother and get a more expensive option straight away or just keep taking iPhone pictures", "What a fantastic little camera!

I was able to set it up right away with my wireless internet. You control it with an app on your phone. It has both a microphone and a speaker, so you can listen for sounds and also speak through the camera itself. That's pretty crazy. It has Night vision, intelligent tracking, motion detection, recording, photos and videos, an alarm system, so many features. SD card support too! You can download what it saves straight to your phone as well as save video length. You can also set up push notifications for motion detection and intelligent tracking. All of this so far is well worth what it costs.  There's really only a couple of downsides. The video and picture quality isn't spectacular. There isn't much zoom at all. It is powered by plug-in only. They (Boavision) DO make an extra-long extension. I had to get it. I also recommend taping the connections just to be safe. There are no batteries. I did try using this with a small solar panel, but it wasn't strong enough to keep it going at night. You really gotta use the plugin.  Intelligent tracking can get a bit too responsive even at the lowest setting; wind really interferes with what it recognizes. I had it set up for push notifications but turned them off on my first windy day. It is not terrible though: I live around a lot of trees, so it's more of a me problem.  Even after all this I'm still learning new things that I can do with it.  If you're looking for a cheap effective camera that works to just keep a check on your home or any area really, I can recommend this one. For the price it is such a great deal. You can also have more than one going at one time. I've been considering getting a second one for a different place at my home. Read more", "My application requires three PTZ Cameras in an outdoor setting using WIFI to replace one Ring camera and expand my surveillance capability on my own cloud service using Synology Surveillance Station on my Synology DS720. I am dropping Ring to rid myself of the subscription service and adopted Synology for photo and video cloud repository/albums from our family cell phones. It is/was imperative that these cameras integrate seamlessly with Synology\u2019s Surveillance Station Software. They advertise it does integrate with Synology, it does, however\u2026  What I found with my interaction with Boavision is a mixed bag. I needed to purchase 5 (make that 6) cameras to get 3 to integrate with Synology. two worked immediately, seamlessly. Two with the CamHipro Monitor Software App for Android The third would get to logon admin/admin but no further, it gets return, camera four two days later. All three work with CamHipro on the original two authenticate with Synology, the new camera (#4) would not authenticate under any circumstance. I was able to IP into each camera using a web browser and mirror all cameras settings, yet the fourth camera wouldn\u2019t authenticate \u2013 nada, not happening - ever.  A email to Boavision clearly indicated that the fourth camera under firmware V18.1.31.11.18.20210622 would not upgrade to a newer version (threw error message) nor authenticate, while the other two under V21.1.34.11.18.20220125 did authenticate immediately with Synology.  Boavision sent a reply with a way to force push the upgrade however in the instructions in clearly states \u201cIf do not obey the instruction for upgrade, the camera maybe damaged totally, customer bear all losses\u201d . So why when you can return to Amazon and get a camera with the correct version sent to you (which I did) camera #5 which arrived DOA, now on Camera 6, why on earth would you waste your time or even risk it?  Remove TWO stars for just ridiculous and foolish customer service, BAD software programing, DOA Cameras etc. If you have an issue with your software upgrading do NOT make it your customers problem - EVER. As I stated to Boavision I have been in IT for YEARS, this is just bad business practice, bad. OK, that\u2019s out of the way so camera six has the correct version so it successfully authenticates with Synology Surveillance Station - IMMEDIATELY. Hey Boavison, I believe we found the problem.  So we are done right, no. Bench testing is near complete. Synology is finding one ore more cameras are dropping, loosing power momentarily during the evening but coming back online pretty quickly. I also need to check the WIFI range beyond the bench to make sure they are range capable then I deploy them.  Bottom line: I like the camera, I really want them to work as they have very good video quality especially for the price point and they do connect to Synology Surveillance Station (perhaps not for the faint of heart) as Boavision states. The bad, Boavision needs to step up customer support do NOT even bother calling them. Why they even list a phone number is beyond me. Email them they do respond fairly quickly however their software does NOT upgrade with its own utility, Boavision feel free to prove me wrong here! As I would be happy to be humbled to see it actually work and not feel threatened to \u201cobey the instruction for upgrade, the camera maybe damaged totally, customer bear all losses\u201d just say\u2019n.  I am a little on the fence with Boavision at this point and will post more as it evolves!  Added....  I field deployed these cameras and initially was very concerned they would not connect to my WIFI in the areas they were located. Not an issue, connected without a problem at all. In deploying the Boavision cameras I did find the new style adapters will not fit in outdoor waterproof electrical boxes, an email to Boavision and an adapter of the old style was shipped and received two days later. Add a star for customer service. , I am happy thus far apart from the zoom not being as robust as I had hoped but at the price point, I guess that is an expected outcome - keep at 4 stars after adding one. Additionally I have resolved most, not all Synology issues but will continue to work those with Synology and Boavision support as needed.  My overall thoughts thus far is this is a good camera especially for the price point, it is especially nice being able to IP into each camera to check and change settings including the admin user name from admin to whatever you want, and the CamHipro really isn't a bad little app. The fact that it does integrate with Synology was critical although the software they have installed to upgrade their firmware apparently it's up to speed if they have to send out instructions to force an update. Bad programming. Customer service is response by email within 3-24 hours, telephone support is no existent - do not bother to try (email only). Overall if you are buying at this price point just to hang a camera outside the house and use a simple Android or Apple app to monitor while away its a no-brainer - hit Buy Now.  11/25/2022 Working as advertised. The video quality at night is not as great as I had hoped and the zoom is not either however the price point drives quality that's the reality. So the trade off is price vs quality. this seems to be a sweet spot between the high end and very low end systems. I can accept them. They do what I need; alert me to movement while away, record events, and allow remote pan-tilt-zoom from halfway across the planet. Understand also you may need to reassign IP address if using the Synology System if you have a power outage as the camera's get reassigned new numbers and the Synology setup will have the IP you assigned at setup. Its an acceptable trade off and takes minutes to make the change. Synology provides a huge amount of secure storage if you choose to go this route. They play well together after I worked the initial bugs out.  Bottom Line: I still rate these cameras a buy.

The picture quality is slightly better than my iPhone (which takes good pictures) and the video quality is great. I really appreciate the wide lens provided and the Manual focus option which works better for me than auto-focus. It seems well constructed and I really like that it comes with a second battery. Definitely a good camera for beginners. The only issue I have is with the audio when recording videos. It\u2019s muffled. I am going to purchase a shotgun mic which as stated in other reviews, easily resolved that issue. Other than that, I love this camera. I would purchase again or recommend it to anyone that wants to take good quality videos and pictures for under $150.", "I recently purchased the \"Digital Cameras for Photography, 4K 48MP Vlogging Camera\" and wanted to share my thoughts on it. First off, I was pleasantly surprised by the packaging \u2013 it was sturdy and well-designed, which is always a good start.  One of the standout features of this camera is its super lightweight design, making it incredibly easy to carry around. This is perfect for on-the-go photography and vlogging. However, I ultimately decided to return it, not because of any flaws in the camera itself, but because I wanted a more high-end camera for my specific needs.  That being said, I must admit that this camera offers a lot of great features for its $100 price point. The 4K resolution and 48MP capability provide excellent image quality, and the 16X digital zoom allows for versatile framing options. I appreciated the inclusion of a 32GB Micro SD card and two batteries, which added to the overall value.  Additionally, the camera comes with a 52mm wide-angle lens and a macro lens, offering versatility for different types of photography. The manual focus option is a nice touch for those who prefer more control over their shots.  In summary, if you're a student or someone looking for a compact and budget-friendly camera with a good set of features, this camera is certainly worth considering. Its lightweight build and the included accessories make it a great option for beginners or those on a tight budget. However, if you're looking for top-tier performance, you may want to explore higher-end models. Read more", "I bought this camera to record my drum practice sessions and I needed to buy at a budget price. This camera met my needs to perform this function.  I record with regular indoor lighting and this camera was able to record clear video at all the available resolutions, although I typically record at 1080p 30 fps to get best results without using a ton of memory space.  The menu is easy to navigate and even though the manual does not go much into depth for describing all the menu functions, I was able to search the web and watch YouTube videos to get a better understanding of the various menu functions. For the most part, I have been using the default menu settings except for Recording Resolution, which I set for 1080P 30fps and metering mode, which I set to Matrix Metering.  The internal microphone is adequate for recording voice audio from within a few feet from the camera, but it was not what I wanted for recording music. I initially had an issue with using external microphones. I contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in responding to my inquiries and helping me resolve my issue with using external microphones. I wanted to record from two speakers that were connected to my E-Drum Kit and connecting the microphones direct to the camera using a stereo Y splitter would not work, also I could not get regular external camera microphones to work either. However, the seller gave me the information I needed to get the right equipment to record the way I wanted to record.  The camera records audio in Mono (one channel) using a 3.5mm (1/8\u201d) TRS mic jack. The camera\u2019s mic input also needed to come from a powered mic source and the mic output must be in Mono. There are many battery powered mics to be found on Amazon. I decided to get a Comica CVM-AX1 mic mixer that can take a Stereo input from two mics and output to the camera in Mono. For my shotgun mic I got a Comica V30 PRO. Both of these mic solutions work great with this camera and each of these two items cost less than $50 each.  I also upgraded the memory card to a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card for around $15  All-in-all, even with these additional items I purchased, it cost a lot less than the $500~$600 price of a brand name camera.  I am happy with this purchase of the Wikico Camera. Read more", "This is exactly what I needed to take better pics of my crafts.

Also small and unobtrusive, hardly notice it. As an aside. I also have an older, indoor model installed outside protected by a 1 quart clear tonic bottle over it (fits great). That indoor camera survived being outside for 2 years so far, and even survived a direct hit by hurricane Ian last year. And still going strong! Wyze will try to up-sell you into a small monthly fee to increase recording time. But I got a micro memory card and get continuous recording for 3+ days at a time, in addition to the 10 seconds you get from wyze for free.", "Excellent cameras, intuitive to set up and use, unbelievable night vision and the recordings are clear enough to be used as evidence in court. I wish the casings were a darker color, they're very easy to spot and therefore disable, I use two cameras that overlap so if someone messes with one camera the other will record it. If they're too near the edge of the WiFi range they'll compete for the WiFi, sometimes only one camera will record an incident they both should have caught, so get a booster or nest routers or something to expand the range. They handle rain just fine but if you use an extension cord get one of those waterproof boxes that protect the connection, the cameras are very sensitive to faults and will shut down if any moisture touches the plug. Every raindrop and quivering leaf triggers a recording but the app lets you adjust the sensitivity. I leave the sensitivity up, I don't mind the near constant recording because the Person/Pet/Vehicle detection is reliable, I have it set to notify me only of those events. I'm not comfortable with the company's response to the security breaches, I only use these outside but even so I don't want a stranger having access. I've used Wyze cameras (pan and stationary) side-by-side with Ring, Blink, and a couple other inexpensive options for two years and the Wyze cameras are by far the most reliable as far as actually recording events -- trespassers, wildlife, package deliveries, Wyze has never missed recording something that another brand picked up but the opposite is frequently true. I have a subscription for unlimited cameras and it's such a good deal because it doesn't restrict you to one location like Ring does, I was responsible for a couple of estate properties as well as my own home so I've had a dozen cameras on one subscription, I couldn't have afforded separate subscriptions. If you're friends with your neighbors you could all put cameras over the street and share a subscription, catch you some porch pirates.

Trae camara, cable, cuadro de energia (5V 2A), manual, chilillos de montaje, base para montar en pared/techo.  De inicio cuando las conectas se mueven, bajas la aplicacion y fueron faciles de instalar y usarlas. Por defecto tiene activado el \"Track Motion\". Le puse una memoria de 64GB. La app es facil de usar y entender. La camara se ve de buen material, se ve bien hecha y resistente.  La calidad de grabacion es decentemente buena, puedes cambiar a 360 o 720.  Los movimientos al girar la camara son suaves, puedes ver las grabaciones facilmente, acceder a ella rapidamente, grabar videos o fotos, puedes darle zoom, poner zonas de grabacion, configurar horarios, eventos, soporta IFTTT, eventos por geolocalizacion (al parecer solo USA y Canada) y otras. Las funciones avanzadas las desconozco, ya que son de paga y basicamente son: guardar en la.nube, sensores de reconocimiento avanzado, acceder por la pagina web de Wyze y otras que no.recuerdo.  Las voy a poner en el exterior y te sugieren (obligado) comprar un adaptador para exterior. Si tienes conocimientos basicos puedes hacer tu propia \"caja\" para poner el cuadro de energia cerca de la camara.  Finalmente, soportan el protocolo RTSP, el cual te permite usarlo con aplicaciones de 3ros, NVR y/o Home Assistant, incluso como camara web. Solo que lei que aun no sale.un firmware para este modelo, seguire leyendo e investigando.  2024.01.11. Con una memoria de 64GB graba aproximadamente 5 a 11 dias. La exterior tiene 5 dias La interior tiene 11 dias Ambas configuradas de la misma manera (HD, grabacion continua, sonido, eventos, vision nocturna).

This is a reliable camera that gets the job done for a good price.", "I've had a couple of the Galayou branded Y4 cameras, as well as a Wansview W7 prior to ordering this one. (Galayou is an alternate branding of the Wansview cameras and uses the same software) The Galayou ones were ok, but I initially had to return several of them due to various issues before I finally got a couple that worked right. Once I got good ones they've been fairly reliable, but they still sometimes seem to have a negative effect on my Wifi network performance. So I decided to try the Wansview branded ones instead to see if they have the same problem. So far, the Wansview ones seem to be better.  Though essentially the same camera as the Y4 and W7 far as features, this Wansview Q5 has a sharper image, even a little better than the W7. Really the quality is quite good for a twenty dollar camera. The contrast is a little low on the Y4 in comparison, while the W7 looks over sharpened in comparison. The main distinguishing difference is the Y4 and W7 supposedly can be used outdoors and have dedicated IR lights, whereas the Q5 seems to be more intended for indoor only use. Of course, I'm not sure I'd want the others outdoors either without at list some protection from the elements. Though the Q5 doesn't have the (visible) IR lights like the others do, it still works quite well in the dark. It's actually a bit more stealthy since you don't see the red glow of the lights in the dark.  Night vision on the Q5 is at least as good as the Y4 and W7, maybe even a little better. I have it set up in a 20x30 garage and it is able to throw enough light to see the opposite wall in total darkness. Not terribly bright, but enough to see what's going on.  Like the others, the pan/tilt function works ok. It's a bit too granular, so it's hard to get it pointed exactly where you want, but I rarely move them so not a big deal to me. Probably more of a software issue than the camera itself.  I didn't see anything about RTSP in the listing, but I took a chance and ordered it anyway. I am happy to report the Q5 DOES support RTSP! It works great with Contacam, which is what I use for motion detection and recording for all my cameras. No need for any cloud services and you can keep your video locally. Because I am using Contacam, I haven't used the built-in motion detection so I can't comment on how well that works.  The mobile app on Android is decent. I've definitely seen worse. I didn't subscribe to any of their cloud features since I use ContaCam, but controlling and configuring the camera is pretty straightforward. One thing I wish it had though is a way to set the frame rate for streaming. Seems to use a lot more bandwidth than I really need just for monitoring.  With both the Galayou and Wansview branded cameras, I always seem to have trouble getting it set up the first time. I don't know what the deal is, but it ends up taking me at least 2 tries. Weird because I don't really do anything different. It just seems finicky.  In summary, I am quite happy with the Q5 so far, especially considering the price. As long as it holds up, I think it's a great deal. Read more", "So far I like this camera. It was easy to set up and the picture quality is good. I use it to check on my dogs when I'm working. I'd buy again.", "So I got this camera to monitor a stray with a severely fractured pelvis that I am fostering. It\u2019s in a 30\u201d kennel mounted in the top corner that\u2019s covered by a sheet often. It\u2019s always what we be considered \u201clow light\u201d so probably the least ideal conditions and I still love it. I have not one ounce of regret. Could it be better? Sure, but I have a feeling most of my cons are addressed in the higher tier items so I\u2019m not complaining at all.  Pros 1 it just works! I didn\u2019t have to fuss and fight with it, didn\u2019t really even read the manual aside from what app to download. I had to try a few times to scan the QR code on my phone, it still only took 3 or 4 minutes. 2 the clarity of the picture in normal & IR mode. It\u2019s gives a nice defined image from close like I have it or across my apartment like when setting it up. it will work great when he\u2019s all healed to maybe catch some fun cat antics in my apartment. 3 on that point the connectivity on the wifi and cellular is fantastic!!! I haven\u2019t had a single issue with it not connecting or behaving improperly once connected. It even warns on cellular that it may use alot of data. Take notes Wyze I think I could go on vacation and actually connect to this camera, I have been converted! 4 It is great in low light, especially if you use the IR light in pitch black situations! I don\u2019t because although the internet says cats can\u2019t see infrared light my kitten disagrees when he tries to hide from the camera when I turn the IR on. 5 the included mounting stuff works great. I may have made a frankenstein out of it now, but once it\u2019s not in the cage that hardware will work great. 6 it does well at all the normal camera stuff it should like adjusting focus, adjusting lighting, moving without binding, taking pictures and videos from the app, reviewing footage\u2026 all the normal stuff.  Cons, they are slight and if I used it like a normal camera all but one wouldn\u2019t be an issue. 1 when you move the camera with the app the camera itself can make a very slight sound. Through the app, it\u2019s a pretty loud sound. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem if it wasn\u2019t 16 inches or less from a hurt/scared kitty\u2026 it doesn\u2019t surprise him after 2 days but he notices. Again it\u2019s really barely noticeable. 2 it sometimes makes a slight \u201cclickity clack\u201d when adjusting the focus when say I reach my hand in the cage. This might not be a thing if mounted more than 2 feet from something. It also may be switching to the non IR night vision (B&W). Again not real loud unless you\u2019re right there, still not a problem. 3 this one is the app, but again it\u2019s probably because of the small kennel it\u2019s in. I wish the motion detection could be less sensitive than it can currently be. Again when 1/3 of the image moves there\u2019s not much you can do. 4 this one isn\u2019t specific to my situation, but I just wish the degrees of rotation for every camera movement up or down/side to side wasn\u2019t so drastic. Not a complaint as the slightly higher priced offerings from WansView probably have finer rotation, I\u2019m just cheap \ud83d\ude01  In conclusion this is a great camera! I will recommend it to anyone that wants a camera to monitor something whether that\u2019s property, pets, people, nature or the inside of a small kennel. It\u2019s just great.

It\u2019s easy to set up and install. The 2K video quality looks very nice. The swappable battery design is super convenient and I plan to get a second battery for backup or maybe get a solar panel for next summer so I can get the battery always topped up. Motion detection is pretty accurate so far and I like how it is able to adjust the detection range. The built-in spotlight is a bonus for the night vision. The only downside is the slow live viewing connection speed which maybe is caused the higher resolution? I heard wyze is improving this by software updates which is good. Overall this is a good battery camera and I like it so far. I will see how long the battery lasts and I will update my review", "Works exactly as expected! Battery life could be a little better, but I attached a solar panel to the mount with the camera and all is well. I use this on my driveway (on the shady side of my house) and set a schedule for only at night (no use in recording when we\u2019re at work) and that solved all my battery issues.  No problems with WiFi connection. It\u2019s a typical Wyze cam thing, yes your WiFi network may need some work to be optimal for these cameras. No your mesh system or system that you spent many dollars on does not automatically mean it\u2019s configured correctly.  Thinking of buying more of these for other angles!", "Update next day: I brought the camera into the house overnight, brought the wifi extender closer inside the garage and this morning it seems to be working better and even charging slowly with the solar panel (panel is only 2w so it will take time). Most movement is getting caught by video, there\u2019s only 2 bars even with wifi extender 15 feet away so I have ordered a wifi mesh system to improve the signal. Let\u2019s hope it continues to improve. Still not happy with lack of response from customer support.  I have V2 and V3 cameras (been happy except app issues) and thought this a logical purchase to replace my old outdoor Arlo cameras. First, it has trouble getting a wifi signal, it shows 1 bar when outside (Arlo and iPhone in same position is fine with full bars), shows being offline or not connected in the app. Even in the room next to the modem with full bars it will not connect. I cannot live stream keep getting error messages, cannot replay videos when they actually get recorded, the error message is \u201cfailed to fetch from iCloud\u201d, will not record video everytime sometimes only a photo when it does detect movement, issues with solar panel not charging but battery on its own will charge so possibly they\u2019re not compatible. Tried reaching out to customer service and keep getting directed to the the chat bot where this camera isn\u2019t even listed for support, there\u2019s a message that Wyze is dealing with \u201cmany issues\u201d right now, must be this camera because the forum comments repeats all the same issues plus more. You cannot reach a real person, all messages say to submit a log, this is not support. When I do get an email reply from customer service they only regurgitate the same information found online. It was exciting when this company first launched the first camera but quality and customer service seems to have declined dramatically, very disappointing to say the least. If firmware is not updated soon this camera and solar panel will be returned. Read more", "I like this camera system. I'm a fan and I purchased the solar panels with it I've been having problems trying to charge these batteries using the solar panels. It seems I have to let the sun cycle the batteries instead of me taking them out and continuously charge them. So what I did was I turned the camera off when it was continuously dying. Even though it was in the sun connected to the solar panels, the battery would still drain. Then the solar panels do not appear to be functioning properly. At 7% I use the app to turn the camera off for 2 days and it appeared it was a good strategy. The battery was charged and continuously recharges itself. After that I bought three cameras, three solar panels. I've had the same results from each and every camera. I don't know why it takes a long for the the battery in the solar panels to be in sync. The quality is undeniable. It's a beautiful picture. You can see everything and everyone and you're surroundings. The downside is, there are little tweaks and small details. That would be nice if it were available to you free but they're not. They're not expensive and they don't cost a lot, but they should come with the system The cameras are still functional without them. They will just be a nice added bonus to having such a nice system.", "I used it with the WYZE solar panel as well, and my camera has stayed at 100% for a few days- even in winter!

Those cameras work great and do not require any mandatory subscription fee", "The fully charged battery only lasted 5 days. Testing it in my living room before using it outdoors. I turned down the spotlight to 25%, as it was too bright. Now recharging the battery again. If it only lasts 5 days again and not the projected \"up to 6 months\" - and it's indoors (warm temperatures), not sure if I'll keep it. I was planning to use it outdoors where I expected the cold temperatures to run the battery down quicker. But indoors and only lasting 5 days is not good.

They are rugged, and just continue to work if installed right.  There are other reviews with samples of the image quality - it\u2019s what you\u2019d expect for $30, probably a little better even. Decent, 2k image with night vision. I\u2019m not going to focus on this as much as a couple of other aspects of this product that I was pleasantly surprised by after install.  These are: The app\u2019s simplicity and streamlined functionality, and the actual camera hardware being compatible with almost every ip camera configuration standard.  The app is surprisingly simple yet useful using the camera\u2019s local micro sd card storage, and can be used locally on the LAN without any subscription, and does not have any blocked features or limited functionality when opting out of the optional cloud subscription. This is much more of a bonus than I had expected. I hadn\u2019t even expected to use the app at all after setup.  Which isn\u2019t necessary after the initial setup, which includes paring the camera with your tp-link ID. Once done, you can set up what they call a \u201ccamera account\u201d, which is in essence setting the camera\u2019s local address for use with third party software and NVR\u2019s via ONVIF (s) standard, or using the RSTP protocol. Overall great for the price.  Only negative I have found is that the frame-rate is set at 15fps and absolutely can\u2019t be changed or reconfigured in any way to manually change the bitrate. The resolution options are what you\u2019d expect (720,1080,2K) but just keep in mind that it\u2019s all at 15fps. Not really a big deal as much for me, something to know. Oh, and the included 9v-0.4A power supply is the only option for power, PoE is NOT supported. The camera\u2019s stream can be connected via ethernet or wifi, but not powered over ethernet as well.  They work for a long time, and are $30, you can\u2019t really go wrong. Read more", "I bought the 2 pack Tapo security camera last month as a upgrade from a similar camera. On my review of that order, I noted that I planned to expand my system with more cameras in the future . About a month has gone by and my feelings for this system are still the same. I added this OUTDOOR camera to replace an older camera on my driveway. The COLOR night time view literally blew me away. At first , I started getting too many false alerts picking up cars on the road. I then made a \"BOX\" for the motion sensing that didn't include the road...Boom..No more false alerts.. I did notice if I enable the \" AI \"mode for vehicles..It still picks up the cars that I didn't include in my motion area I chose...it seems Like it overrides the box and looks at the whole screen. This was easily fixed by disabling the AI for AUTOs. Setup was a breeze , just adding it to my other 2 Tapo cameras . Details are clear and I can easily read a license plate anywhere in my driveway. Alerts are sent almost instantly , and I will probably activate the free trial on this camera for offline storage. Remember to buy the 256 gb SD card when you buy these cameras. 2 screws must be removed to put the SD card in , and they are tiny tiny screws. Once you insert the card , you will be good to go. The software will format the card , and you can choose 24/7 recording , or motion activated recording. Record the motion clips that you want , save them to memory , then go to memory and you can view , download , or delete the clips to your phone. You can do all of this without a subscription. It's a great addition to my security system , and I plan to add the Battery Powered cameras in time so I can view my backyard . Tapo has proven to be a great family of security cameras for all situations. Whether it a baby monitor , outdoor , wireless , battery powered, or motion tracking , this collection is great and all work together with one well written ,easy to use app. Keep up the great work Tapo !  UPDATE : After a couple of months use , I thought I would add to this review. Now , someone user left a Lengthy review and 90 percent of it is user error. You can EASILY record video to your phone from the SD card without removing anything. If you get a notification , So .... The way to save videos does actually vary between my indoor and outdoor cameras . The Indoor cameras have 3 dots after the clip , and if you select the 3 dots it gives you the option to DOWNLOAD the clip . Selecting this DOWNLOADS the clip to the MEMORY of your SD CARD ... Then if you look up toward the top of the screen .. You will be able to select \" Memory \" and all the clips you downloaded will be here .... Selecting the clip you want will give you the option to delete , view , or even Download this video to you phone .  NOW ... the Outdoor camera has changed a little bit on how to do this without a subscription....When you are watching the selected video , you must press the little camera button while viewing the video , then press it again to stop the recording ... It will the save the clip you recorded to the \" MEMORY \" section of the SD CARD.. At this point you can click on the clip to view , delete , or DOWNLOAD it to your phone! It's 2 easy steps to save it on your phone...Once you know how to do it , it's very easy....Don't believe the users that say you can't save clips to your phone ..  Now for an actual small issue I had . My outdoor camera has an occasional issue ...I attribute this to the distance from my router. Last week , the spotlight stayed on for a couple days???...I unplugged the unit..Rebooted it...multiple times and it was not working correctly... I will admit I was a little upset..but I decided to do a factory reset by pushing the reset button that's in the SD card cover...That was the best thing I could have done ..I reconnected it to my app ..And the camera is now working correct again.... No dropouts , Motion Spotlight works , and I am happy it was just a factory reset that it took to fix it .. It's been working good for 2 weeks straight now ...We did have a power outage a couple weeks ago , and I think that may have messed my outdoor camera up a bit ..Overall...I still think it's the best budget camera system you can get.. No monthly fees and still does everything I want it to do .  After months of use, I came up with the following way to set my camera up as the best for my driveway ,and sidewalk . I DISABLED motion sensing , as ANY motion including trees , shadows , distant cars , would always trigger alerts , I disabled the vehicle sensing as it would alert me of all the cars on the road .. I set \" Person \" alert and this picks up all \" people \" riding or walking and works perfect ... The other setting I enabled was \" Line crossing \" and made a line that gives me a notification if anything crosses the middle of my driveway . The combo of Line crossing , and Person alert has made this system work the way I wanted it to .. I see my driveway , and the road but do not get alerts for the traffic on the road .. Only if they pull in my driveway ... The person detection seems to work great when a person is walking anywhere ... It took a little bit of playing to reduce false alerts ... But now that I have it tweaked out , it is an amazing system to have. Read more", "I made the mistake of first buying Defender brand cameras, trying to support a Canadian brand. That was a huge mistake. Their cameras are terrible, and that assumes you can EVERY get them hooked up to the internet. Good luck with that. These ones took LITERALLY less than 10 seconds to connect and get working. Unreal. Pictures quality is great, the AI feature is nice too as I use these at work. I plan on buying more and would highly recommend a brand like TP Link. FYI, their app is also really nice and easy to use, unlike the Defender app which looks very dated.", " La relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio es excelente, graba es 2K, tiene alertas de movimiento, de personas, manipulaci\u00f3n de la c\u00e1mara, etc. muy f\u00e1cil de instalar y configurar; tiene una excelente recepci\u00f3n wifi, es pr\u00e1ctica y si le insertas una memoria SD, puedes grabar y posteriormente revisar, la controlas desde tu celular en la aplicaci\u00f3n \u201ctapo\u201d; puedes tener la luz led de la c\u00e1mara encendida o no, creo que es, adem\u00e1s, un inhibidor para los amigos de lo ajeno.

Over the past 3 days I've tested the cameras with my rather strict requirements in order for what I needed. This camera has a lot of smart features built in to allow for reliable offline operations and smart \"AI\" features built in which allows for a wide array of alerts. Initially it was a pain to get the alerts dialed in so that I wasn't bombarded with notifications 24/7. However once done, I only received notification when an actual event was detected. My recommendation if you're using it in the manner I was (as shown in photos.) Make your detection areas smaller and set the sensitivity between 2-4.  Overall the camera has clear video quality, however I found myself switch starlight mode off as the camera's LEDs appeared to be always on during the night.  The downside of this camera is it's power connector. The provided connector is not waterproof and while the 3M cable is plenty long for most people in my case I found it to be too short in 2 out of 3 areas I have this camera installed.  Lastly the main advantage of a camera such as this one is the \"open\" nature of the software the RTSP and being able to use this to add the camera to Homekit has allowed this camera to integrate well with my setup. However, I cannot say the same for the \"supported\" Google Home setup as you will need a smart display to be able to view the feed from this Camera.  Better, more detailed review will be included in about a month's time from now. Overall, I would recommend this camera to others especially considering it's NVR support, built in detection and great price point.  Cloud storage is being tested, overall okay nothing special in my opinion.

I was expecting to receive a subpar camera as the price is pretty low, but the camera has great quality, easy smart phone assess, easy setup, and great resolution. I have already bought two because of how simple and easy it was to setup and use. The two way talk function is spectacular as I have used it to communicate with both a family member and my pet. It allows me to easily check on both of them in seconds. The human detection and motion tracking features also work exactly as advertised. The app will alert me whenever someone walks in front of the camera and will track the person which lets me feel confident that I won't miss a thing. I would 100% recommend this product for it's low price, but incredible quality!", "This is a good camera system for the price and ease of use. I have two of them set up to observe my pets while we are away on vacations or long outings, and they work just fine. Even at night, the picture is still clear enough to see what's going on. This camera does have a motion detection feature, but be aware that it is not a continuous video once motion is detected, but instead a screenshot and a message notifying the user that there has been movement. The picture quality is not like an HDTV, nor would you expect that from a camera system so moderately priced, but the overall quality is still more than good enough to observe what is going on in the area where you have set it up. The speaker system works well, as you can both speak and be heard through it. Once again, it should be noted that this is not an expensive home security system and therefore expectations should not be unreasonable. For the moderate price, you get a good and reliable camera system, and if your needs are simple this will work just fine for you. I am happy with the system and plan to add one more camera. Connectivity to the app, as well as the usability of the overall system, is fairly easy.", "perfect live cam and so easy to use with the app on my phone. Intercom works well too. I think its a great value.", "MUBVIEW Baby Monitor with Camera and Audio. Let's start the review with an overall design. I love the look and the feel of it. Little elegant looking camera that looks like a furniture accent, blends well with the interior. Good quality device.Comes with instructions, a mounting bracket and screws, and a USB/AC plug.  One could stand it on a surface or screw to the ceiling upside down (in the settings you would need to flip the screen). The electrical cable is relatively somewhat short, but since it's a USB, you could potentially get an extension USB cable (not included). This camera must be plugged in at all times to function.  The quality of the still images is superb, even in night mode, and the live feed is very good. You can select between qualities of the pictures, but keep in mind it will consume your SD card faster at HD images. The two way audio is good quality, you need to press a mike button on your phone, to speak, but the camera speaker is always on. There is a bit of a lag in audio/video, but that is normal from my experience. You could make screenshots and instantly share them, which is very convenient. You can zoom with your fingers off the screen. Remotely controlling the camera is easy, and effective, it rotates almost full circle, and has a good range top to bottom. If installed right, the camera can overlook the entire room on its own. Great peripheral field of view. Also of note the night mode takes pictures and has a live feed in black and white, versus daytime is in colour.  I couldn't find the sd card slot initially, its hidden behind the lens, you would have to roll the lens all the way up (see the pictures). Unfortunately The sd card is not included, so i could not test it with it, i would have to buy one later. The installation is fairly straightforward, you download the app, and follow the instruction wizard, register, connect and you are good to go. Plenty of languages for your interface to chose from (see pics).  Motion detection works well (i turned it off because every time the dog walks by it sends you a message, which is good if you need this working well). Easy access from the app to the live feed, no authentication needed, which on certain products is quite annoying.  The recording and data storage available in 2 options: SD card, or cloud storage. The amazon product description ad mentions a free 7 day loop recording storage cloud, but all i could find is an offer for a subscription, I will be calling the customer service to verify this information, because it is a little confusing (see pictures).  Overall we are very satisfied with the product, its priced fair, and performs well. 5/5 Read more", "Wir haben uns f\u00fcr zwei dieser Kameras entschieden, um unseren Hund in unserer Abwesenheit beobachten zu k\u00f6nnen.

It needs two AAA batteries to work and a Micro SD card, neither are included in the kit. Granted, this does have its pros and cons as rechargeable batteries for cameras can be very specific and costly if you want backups, but any AAA batteries will work for this, just make sure you have them on hand. For stuff like this I tend to buy rechargeable batteries so I essentially have exactly what I need just in a different form to keep this powered up. In terms of picture quality, it ranges from low quality, about 2m up to 16m, depending on your preferences and storage space for your device. The interface is fine, you'll get used to it eventually if this is your first time using a Polaroid or digital camera. Not exactly intuitive but, again, it will just take a couple uses to get in the groove of using this quickly. Initial setup was simple enough to figure out in terms of setting up my language and time/date. There's a function to automatically send photos to a social media account of your choice, do I haven't really mess with that too much. I got this as a gift from my mother for upcoming trips and cruises on the horizon. The strap included wraps around tightly and gives a good grip around your wrist in case of sudden drops or going over Bridges and you do not want to risk the camera falling away. The waterproof casing is something I have yet to fully test but it is noticeable mostly around the battery port which is pretty tricky to open, at least with one hand, and has a Tight Seal around to protect the battery and memory card so do use a bit of force when pushing this open. The data cable is fine, pretty standard USB type a cable for transferring photos back and forth between computers and the camera itself. The color is extremely accurate for the product, a very distinctive vibrant blue, and the matching silicone case is the same general color but provides a stronger grip all around the camera to make this easy to use for beginners or Pros alike.

Though I was initially discouraged by the reviews about the poor photo quality, I decided to buy it after reading the headline, \"Only slightly better than a disposable camera.\" Our only other option was a disposable camera and this was a way better option, considering the price, the large number of photos it could hold, and its ability to also take video. It also was the only inexpensive digital camera that used batteries, which was essential in our case.  Sure, the picture quality isn't great but it definitely captured very special memories -- even the memory of the camera accidentally falling into the water and being perfectly fine. (He then took a video as he deliberately jumped in the water holding the camera.) When the camera first arrived we took some test pictures indoors with the flash and they really were quite terrible (a grey wall--and everything else-- appeared orange!) but at camp without a flash the colors look perfectly fine. Close-ups aren't always focused on the intended object. Outdoor, daytime, long-view scenic shots turned out best and are quite nice!  We were able to upload the pictures to our computers and watch the videos with sound (playback on the camera is visual only).

I was expecting to receive a subpar camera as the price is pretty low, but the camera has great quality, easy smart phone assess, easy setup, and great resolution. I have already bought two because of how simple and easy it was to setup and use. The two way talk function is spectacular as I have used it to communicate with both a family member and my pet. It allows me to easily check on both of them in seconds. The human detection and motion tracking features also work exactly as advertised. The app will alert me whenever someone walks in front of the camera and will track the person which lets me feel confident that I won't miss a thing. I would 100% recommend this product for it's low price, but incredible quality!", "This is a good camera system for the price and ease of use. I have two of them set up to observe my pets while we are away on vacations or long outings, and they work just fine. Even at night, the picture is still clear enough to see what's going on. This camera does have a motion detection feature, but be aware that it is not a continuous video once motion is detected, but instead a screenshot and a message notifying the user that there has been movement. The picture quality is not like an HDTV, nor would you expect that from a camera system so moderately priced, but the overall quality is still more than good enough to observe what is going on in the area where you have set it up. The speaker system works well, as you can both speak and be heard through it. Once again, it should be noted that this is not an expensive home security system and therefore expectations should not be unreasonable. For the moderate price, you get a good and reliable camera system, and if your needs are simple this will work just fine for you. I am happy with the system and plan to add one more camera. Connectivity to the app, as well as the usability of the overall system, is fairly easy.", "perfect live cam and so easy to use with the app on my phone. Intercom works well too. I think its a great value.", "MUBVIEW Baby Monitor with Camera and Audio. Let's start the review with an overall design. I love the look and the feel of it. Little elegant looking camera that looks like a furniture accent, blends well with the interior. Good quality device.Comes with instructions, a mounting bracket and screws, and a USB/AC plug.  One could stand it on a surface or screw to the ceiling upside down (in the settings you would need to flip the screen). The electrical cable is relatively somewhat short, but since it's a USB, you could potentially get an extension USB cable (not included). This camera must be plugged in at all times to function.  The quality of the still images is superb, even in night mode, and the live feed is very good. You can select between qualities of the pictures, but keep in mind it will consume your SD card faster at HD images. The two way audio is good quality, you need to press a mike button on your phone, to speak, but the camera speaker is always on. There is a bit of a lag in audio/video, but that is normal from my experience. You could make screenshots and instantly share them, which is very convenient. You can zoom with your fingers off the screen. Remotely controlling the camera is easy, and effective, it rotates almost full circle, and has a good range top to bottom. If installed right, the camera can overlook the entire room on its own. Great peripheral field of view. Also of note the night mode takes pictures and has a live feed in black and white, versus daytime is in colour.  I couldn't find the sd card slot initially, its hidden behind the lens, you would have to roll the lens all the way up (see the pictures). Unfortunately The sd card is not included, so i could not test it with it, i would have to buy one later. The installation is fairly straightforward, you download the app, and follow the instruction wizard, register, connect and you are good to go. Plenty of languages for your interface to chose from (see pics).  Motion detection works well (i turned it off because every time the dog walks by it sends you a message, which is good if you need this working well). Easy access from the app to the live feed, no authentication needed, which on certain products is quite annoying.  The recording and data storage available in 2 options: SD card, or cloud storage. The amazon product description ad mentions a free 7 day loop recording storage cloud, but all i could find is an offer for a subscription, I will be calling the customer service to verify this information, because it is a little confusing (see pictures).  Overall we are very satisfied with the product, its priced fair, and performs well. 5/5 Read more", "Wir haben uns f\u00fcr zwei dieser Kameras entschieden, um unseren Hund in unserer Abwesenheit beobachten zu k\u00f6nnen.

It was pretty easy to set up when you follow the instructions and the video quality is also good (both day time and night vision). The one thing that I would note (and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that is does not come with an SD card which you need for storage. If you don't use an SD card, you'll have to sign up for cloud storage which has a subscription cost.

I got it for myself to use and take pictures. I wasn't sure how good it was gonna because in the description it says kids camera, but I thought I would give it a try and see. So far, this seems to be a great camera for taking pictures or video. Easy to use, all buttons are easy to push and use. You can see the picture you take on the screen and if you don't like it, delete it. Comes with it's own memory card already in the camera. Also, comes with the cord for charging and plugging into your computer for transferring pictures to it. (One cord)  Has great clarity and takes beautiful pictures. Very surprised how well the pictures come out. Also, has automatic flash and you can turn flash on or off. Has zooming too. Haven't tried everything on it, just a few pics so far. But it was very easy to use and I am very satisfied with it.  Not many people use camera anymore, they just use their phones. I just wanted a camera because I prefer them over the phone camera. Works great and very satisfied with it.  Comes with a nice booklet with instructions on how to use everything and is very easy to read.  The price is great for this Camera. Easy for anyone to use. I feel it's a little more advanced for younger children but would be great for ages 12 yrs and up.  Highly Recommend It. Would make a wonderful gift too.

This camera isn't going to compare with what any modern smartphone is capable of, but if you have or know of a kid that isn't ready for a smartphone yet, but they have an interest in taking pictures, this could honestly be great. The build quality of the camera isn't anything magical, and it doesn't have a touchscreen, but it does have all the options and auto-features that you'd want.  Kids should be able to pick up the basic functions of this camera very quickly, although there's a lot of more in-depth things that they'll likely need help with, such as transferring the pictures off the camera, which is done by connecting a USB from it to your computer, which mounts it as a removable device that you can transfer the pictures from (think USB flash drive).  Also worth mentioning, this camera has more granular controls available, if you or your child wants to explore them, such as as exposure time and ISO sensitivity, and I will also mention that the manual is a bit dated, as the computer requirements reference things like Windows XP/Vista/7, and a Macintosh G3, but it should be just fine.

She is mid 30's so she isnt a kid at all but her son, my grandson, is rather severely autistic so he often commandeers things he likes even if they are hears which is the main reason i got this camera that was rated for kids as well.  i scored big time with this one. not only does my daughter enjoy using it and she says its perfect to just keep in her bag or in her glove box, but even with her son snatching it a time or two it delighted him that he was able to figure out how to use it and they both love the quality pictures it gives.  now granted its not a 5 grand dslr.... so take that into consideration when you get this. this is aw step ONE type camera not a professional photogs piece of equipment.  It frustrates me when I read about something not being top of the line perfection when the item CLEARLY states the level the item is and what to expect.  In my view there was NO deception in the description of what this is and does and the suggested expectations of its ability is spot on.

I have no complaints. It being all wireless, no messy wires to deal with. The solar powered grid is fast charging during daylight hours and stays fully charged at night. Even cloudy days it still charges at a nice rate. The wireless feature I would say is the best part. You can conveniently move it anywhere you want with in Wi-Fi range. It\u2019s easy to set up as well. I pay $1.99 a month for I\u2019m assuming storage and playback of triggered events if that\u2019s not why I pay $1.99 a month then whatever I pay that for it\u2019s worth whatever services I\u2019m getting to run this little power house of a camera. The playback of triggered events are always clear and very quick after the sensor is triggered. Night vision playback is crystal clear. I think there is 3 lights that help play a role in the excellent night vision playback. It has all kinds of setting to tailor this camera to your liking. My trigger play back for each event was set on 8 sec of recording time but it wasn\u2019t enough for me so I played around with the settings until I figured out how to make it longer and I made it record now up to 20 seconds. I could praise this little camera for days. It just brings me so much piece of mind while I\u2019m at work and I get an alert on my phone I can quickly look to see what\u2019s going on at my house, or just check things out in real time. I\u2019ve owned a few wireless security cameras over the years and this by far is the best priced, working easy camera I\u2019ve ever owned. So much I\u2019ve already bought a second one. I don\u2019t have it set up but I\u2019ll leave a review when I do on that purchase one. To Test out how well both cameras preform on one app! I\u2019m not sure how many can be link at once but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s multiples! Only thing I would say is a con is the sensitivity of alerts, but that\u2019s just a problem I\u2019ll have to figure out over time, or maybe set up the other one closer to where I would like it to trigger motion better. I wanted mine to trigger the traffic that passes by my little country rd I live on but I\u2019ve not mastered how to get that to happen yet. You just have to play with the sensitivity to get it to your liking. If you are getting to many or not enough alerts to your liking the setting options are easy to find and set all that up. Costumer services is nice as well if you have a problem. They are very helpful if you run into a problem. I have no complaints. Theses things are everything I need in a security camera and more. I just love the simplicity of the whole deal. Read more", "I read all of the reviews on this and a number of other cameras before buying anything. I was torn because I saw all the reviews saying how this one doesn\u2019t charge, it just stops working, and that you can\u2019t get recordings with a SD card. All of these have been very untrue for me so far.  I\u2019ve had this for 2 weeks now. If anything changes with it then I will update my review. I get the notifications within seconds, it only ever notifies me for people (never packages, animals, bugs, etc), the sound quality is excellent, the picture is crystal clear, every single thing that should have been has been recorded, I have a SD card in it, I can play whatever days\u2019 recordings I want, and it stays 100% charged at all times for me.  The trick to the solar panel is making sure you put it in direct sunlight and a place with no obstructions where the sun shines for most of the day. As far as the recordings on a SD card are concerned, they don\u2019t get stored on the app in the same place you\u2019d find the recordings if you had a subscription. They\u2019re stored in with the messages. If you hit the home button in the app and make sure the top tab is on alarm then it will list each device you have set up. Tap on the name of the device you want to watch your recordings from. After that you can pick whatever day you want on the calendar and it\u2019ll show you every recording from that day. It stores it on the live feed when you record on a SD card and replays it from there instead of from the recording library/history.  This was extremely easy to install and again has worked flawlessly for us for a couple of weeks so far. It was a little annoying having to figure out how to get to my recordings in the app, but other than that, I am extremely happy so far. If that changes then I\u2019ll come back to update this review. I personally would get another one if I needed it.  ** UPDATE **  I just wanted to come on here to say I\u2019ve had this for between 4 and 5 months now and it\u2019s still working the exact same way it always has. The only thing that\u2019s complicated is signing multiple devices into the same profile on the app. You have to create a separate profile on the app for each person and then create a family that has everyone in it, but if they get a new phone then they might not be able to get back on.

Moreover, I\u2019ve tried many brands of cameras, but after getting the Aosu doorbell camera, I liked it so much I got one for my family. After that I got half a dozen of Aosu pan and tilt indoor. There were things in the user interface that I didn\u2019t like and the company responded to the feedback within one update. Everything I mentioned was added! I\u2019ve never met a company that actually implemented individual feedback. Usually the company collects a bunch of feedback and if enough people ask for the same thing, then they implement it eventually.  Aosu cameras have great quality. They have something other UI don\u2019t have, which is an indication of events on the playback track itself. You can jump to an event which is coloured in blue, or you can start recording before the event (but if you want to record the event with before and after make sure you start recording slightly before the event in blue otherwise it will record the event and say \u201cfile saved\u201d). The audio is great, however I don\u2019t ever use the family call button. I use the cameras on 5 GHz internet but the good thing is you can use both! Other cameras only use 2.4. The main reason I selected Aosu is the value = pan and tilt + 2K quality. Very good price for the features you get and the user interface is quite pleasant.

Moreover, I\u2019ve tried many brands of cameras, but after getting the Aosu doorbell camera, I liked it so much I got one for my family. After that I got half a dozen of Aosu pan and tilt indoor. There were things in the user interface that I didn\u2019t like and the company responded to the feedback within one update. Everything I mentioned was added! I\u2019ve never met a company that actually implemented individual feedback. Usually the company collects a bunch of feedback and if enough people ask for the same thing, then they implement it eventually.  Aosu cameras have great quality. They have something other UI don\u2019t have, which is an indication of events on the playback track itself. You can jump to an event which is coloured in blue, or you can start recording before the event (but if you want to record the event with before and after make sure you start recording slightly before the event in blue otherwise it will record the event and say \u201cfile saved\u201d). The audio is great, however I don\u2019t ever use the family call button. I use the cameras on 5 GHz internet but the good thing is you can use both! Other cameras only use 2.4. The main reason I selected Aosu is the value = pan and tilt + 2K quality. Very good price for the features you get and the user interface is quite pleasant.  The customer service is always on the ball. You can message them through Amazon or through Aosu app and they always reply and resolve. I love that. No wonder I got half a dozen cameras from them!

Once in a blue moon the app tends to crash or I should say the camera feed crashes and doesn't connect and I have to force close the app and restart otherwise they have been rock solid without any issues regarding camera functionality.  I will definitely be replacing all my Wyze cameras with this brand going forward. My next purchase will be their outdoor solar panel motion capture cameras.

Takes good pictures but the quality is not so great. Gets the job done and it\u2019s amazing watching your little one snap away", "My nephews love these cameras and functionally they seem to work pretty great. They are easy for them to learn as well. They are seven years old. My only complaints are that the lanyards are very cheap and broke within an hour of using them. And the main issue I have is the sound on the cameras. The sound should just be for when you\u2019re watching videos playback, or playing games. But instead it makes a loud annoying beep with every single button that\u2019s pressed. Which is pretty awful for parents having to listen to that or really anyone around hearing the constant beeping.", "My son really liked it. It's simple enough for a 6yo to operate but still has the important functions. The photos are nice, the photoarea is smaller than what we are used to now, but for a kid, it's ok. It is very light, easy to hold. What i don't like, is if i mute the sound of the menu, it mutes the videos as well, so we will just have to get used to the little beeps. It was funny that my son is so used to touch-screens, that he needed some time to learn how to navigate with buttons :D", "This camera gives me so much nostalgia because of the date and time at the bottom of the photo. All I had to do outside of buying this camera was buy a USB for transferring photos to my phone\u2026 Everything about this camera is so fun.

The picture quality is terrible, I would have expected much more from this camera for the $54.38 that it cost. I'd recommend buy a cheap fun real digital camera for your kids. My son loves doing stuff with it, but you cant really tell what is going on in it.  The flash.... just ignore it its worthless.  There is a cartoony kinda look to all the pictures if you've ever seen the cartoon filter.  Cool feature of the camera is it has a selfie mode for both video and picture.  This would be an awesome camera if the picture quality wasn't so blasted terrible.", "My son loves his camera.

I tested it with both ethernet connection and wifi connection. Both worked great. The only concern is that it needs connecting to power source. Fortunately, I have a outdoor light, that I could use its power wire to connect. Otherwise, you have to drill hole on the wall and tried to wire. This is the drawback. If battery can be deployed it would be better. However, it doesn't have this feature. So this is something you need to think about before purchasing. Otherwise, it is a great one, especially you can display it on a computer/laptop or mobile devices.", "Es dif\u00edcil de instalar", "I use cameras to monitor rat activity for a place I am responsible for keeping under control. I have attempted to use indoor cameras in areas where the wifi signal was relatively poor - too poor to run the cameras. Consequently I had to use trail cameras in these areas and go in to manually check the SD cards on a daily basis. I have since installed three EZVIZ C8C cameras in these areas. The antennas receive the wifi signal good enough to use full function of the cameras and allow me to check activity from anywhere I am.", "I own many EzViz cameras(13) and for some reason they cannot design an outdoor WiFi camera that has any sort of range. Their tiny indoor WiFi cameras, of which I own 6, all have much better range and connection stability. I have one of those in my shed window(inside), probably 80 feet from my house, and it's works great. Over the last few years I've bought multiple iterations of their outdoor cameras starting with the \"Husky\" then to the newer version of the Husky and now these pan/tilt cameras. These are an all new design with external antennas, so I had had high hopes that they had improved the WiFi, but no, these are as bad and maybe worse than all their previous outdoor WiFi cams. A little background; I have the latest Google Nest mesh router system in my house, there is literally coverage everywhere, and 800Mbps internet. When I take my dog for a walk my phone stays connected to my WiFi for 150' down the street. All 3 of these new cams are mounted to the side of my house, and all of them are no more than 15' from one of the mesh router nodes. Two of them only have to transmit through one exterior wall, the other transmits through one exterior and one interior wall. Overall I'd say these connect with the app less than 50% of the time, sometimes an entire day will go by and they won't connect. And when they do connect and you get a picture it's usually unstable and pixilated, and then just drops out completely. Once again, this isn't an isolated incident, I bought THREE of these and they're all the same amount of sh!tty, just like their outdoor camera predecessors.

A couple issues I have though, which I can deal with or remedy. Mine is mounted on the corner of house and the downspout is directly in front of it. If I have it facing that direction at night with NV IR light on it lights up the downspout so bright that it washes out everything behind it. I had to get black felt and lay it along the downspout so it didn't have the reflection.  Other issue is the mic. Even a small breeze sounds like loud static interference. Like it does when you blow into a microphone. So if it were windy and you were trying to listen to what people are saying you wouldn't be able to hear them over the wind noise. I'll try and find the mic location to see if I can tape foam over it or something...  Other than those 2 issues it's a amazing. I made a corner mount, and can see the front of my house as well as the side of my house. Perfect!

I have two of them set up to observe my pets while we are away on vacations or long outings, and they work just fine. Even at night, the picture is still clear enough to see what's going on. This camera does have a motion detection feature, but be aware that it is not a continuous video once motion is detected, but instead a screenshot and a message notifying the user that there has been movement. The picture quality is not like an HDTV, nor would you expect that from a camera system so moderately priced, but the overall quality is still more than good enough to observe what is going on in the area where you have set it up. The speaker system works well, as you can both speak and be heard through it. Once again, it should be noted that this is not an expensive home security system and therefore expectations should not be unreasonable. For the moderate price, you get a good and reliable camera system, and if your needs are simple this will work just fine for you. I am happy with the system and plan to add one more camera.

I think its a great value.", "MUBVIEW Baby Monitor with Camera and Audio. Let's start the review with an overall design. I love the look and the feel of it. Little elegant looking camera that looks like a furniture accent, blends well with the interior. Good quality device.Comes with instructions, a mounting bracket and screws, and a USB/AC plug.  One could stand it on a surface or screw to the ceiling upside down (in the settings you would need to flip the screen). The electrical cable is relatively somewhat short, but since it's a USB, you could potentially get an extension USB cable (not included). This camera must be plugged in at all times to function.  The quality of the still images is superb, even in night mode, and the live feed is very good. You can select between qualities of the pictures, but keep in mind it will consume your SD card faster at HD images. The two way audio is good quality, you need to press a mike button on your phone, to speak, but the camera speaker is always on. There is a bit of a lag in audio/video, but that is normal from my experience. You could make screenshots and instantly share them, which is very convenient. You can zoom with your fingers off the screen. Remotely controlling the camera is easy, and effective, it rotates almost full circle, and has a good range top to bottom. If installed right, the camera can overlook the entire room on its own. Great peripheral field of view. Also of note the night mode takes pictures and has a live feed in black and white, versus daytime is in colour.  I couldn't find the sd card slot initially, its hidden behind the lens, you would have to roll the lens all the way up (see the pictures). Unfortunately The sd card is not included, so i could not test it with it, i would have to buy one later. The installation is fairly straightforward, you download the app, and follow the instruction wizard, register, connect and you are good to go. Plenty of languages for your interface to chose from (see pics).  Motion detection works well (i turned it off because every time the dog walks by it sends you a message, which is good if you need this working well). Easy access from the app to the live feed, no authentication needed, which on certain products is quite annoying.  The recording and data storage available in 2 options: SD card, or cloud storage. The amazon product description ad mentions a free 7 day loop recording storage cloud, but all i could find is an offer for a subscription, I will be calling the customer service to verify this information, because it is a little confusing (see pictures).

My family and I often travel to this location and we always see turtles and frogs leaping into the water. I got curious as to what else might be under the water.  The camera is built solid. One of the most important features for me is the ability to see the LCD screen and then switch to the front LCD, although it is a bit smaller than the back one I still get a good idea when filming myself.  So far the picture quality is very nice, sharp and crisp resolution. There is a 5k resolution but it's not 16 by 9 it is square in 4 by 3 and only at 15 FPS so that is something to consider.

The quality of picture is great and the audio transfer is seamless too. Highly recommend value for money product. The best part is you don't have to pay for any recurring subscription cost for the camera to work.", "I love almost everything about this camera. The night vision is clear, motion tracking works most of the time unless you're walking fast, then it just gives up like a cop in a Ford that just had a Lambo speed past. The picture quality is great & is only hindered by our slow & spotty country Internet. I bought this camera specifically for the time lapse feature which I think is cute as heck. I just wish it could do motion tracking at the same time, but you have to turn that feature off in order to do time lapse, which you also have to manually tell it to do unlike a more expensive competing camera that does it automatically every day. It also only does a 6 hour -> 30 second maximum time lapse unlike the other brand which does double. I did have an issue with downloading videos from the cloud. You can only download them in 10 minute or less segments & I kept getting the same video over & over & over again from 4 days earlier. The software is buggy. I wrote tech support but never heard back from anyone *update: I just got a reply from tech support. They didn't help with my Groundhog Day issue when downloading clips to my phone, but told me how to use the desktop software (which I already knew how to use). The software must have updated, because all of a sudden buttons on the desktop software works! Not all of them & not all the time, but most of them & most of the time. I was able to see my cloud videos, download to my PC, & even go fullscreen finally! The fullscreen option took about half a dozen clicks before it finally worked each time & the same with closing the software, but we're making progress! I'm so glad I can do this on my PC finally because I'm old & my phone screen is a pain in the butt to see. :) . Back to the downloading videos to the phone; I found a way around it, but it took a while. For anyone wanting to know why their videos are stuck in Groundhog day even though you've deleted all the downloaded videos & started over, it's because you have to delete each video while you're in the screen to be watching it, NOT in the screen that lists all the downloaded videos. It's the only way. Once you delete it from there, it will still be saved on your phone but within the software itself it will be gone & the next video you download will actually be the one you were intending to get. Also, the desktop software for the PC lets you view the live footage, but that's it. None of the other buttons work except for the one to purchase cloud storage. The X to close the program doesn't even work ... you have to right click on your bottom bar & close it from there. Again, great camera, REALLY buggy software. Finally, it does connect quickly & easily to your Amazon echo devices & you can view the live camera from there too with just a simple command. If they ever get their software debugged & working better, I would really like to buy another one that's capable of being mounted outside (this one isn't waterproof). I gave it 4 stars ... it lost 1 star for software that doesn't really work well yet (phone app & pc). If it weren't for the software that you kinda NEED to use the camera, the hardware alone would get 5 stars for being super fast & easy to set up right out of the box, great features, & picture quality. Read more", "Easy to use and affordable. Love these cameras. They're working great for me.", "UPDATE LATEST: THIS IS A CRAP CAMERA AND BAD COMPANY. It has potential, if YI did it right it would be fantastic. They put out app updates several times a month apparently to push their Cloud service instead of improving the app. The cameras firmware last update was 2019, so they obviously do not care about camera flaws. I have tried working with YI to no avail. NOT recommended CRAP CAMERA AND COMPANY. UPPDATE: Putting up with all the other flaws (see Previous below). Found a feature to use but that is flawed also. The feature is Auto Cruise which uses Bookmarks. This feature is useful but with a problem. After a time of use the camera view slowly vanishes to beyond the lip (like the privacy mode - lens goes hidden), this will happen in 6-10 hours. You then have to turn camera off/on to reset position. I have been working with YI but they are resisting a fix in app. The SD card seems to be disabled - forcing cloud usage. I don't want YI's cloud because I am rural and no real data. (Also don't like being manipulated to use cloud which YI/Kami seems to be forcing over time.) ORIGINAL: At one time I was impressed, but not so much anymore. The Sensitivity is useless now - it triggers on tiny spiders 20ft away on any setting. On Human a person has to be looming close in view to trigger - no good - not real AI, just blob mode. The SD card mode only shows 2 days (regardless of how large SD is) - I have a 32gb card that is full of what?, 2 days at 200mb? They use to record and let you see an optional 30 seconds off YOUR/my SD, but now only 6 seconds. The activity pic panel is decent but timeline is useless now. It acts like you get 2 days of cloud for free but no real evidence. I don't want cloud though - don't have the bandwidth or allotment. Don't know how to disable. Made the mistake of buying another YI (replacing a defective one - have 5 now) a few months ago thinking they would straighten things out - so far not! Summary: YI has gone seriously down hill.

I appreciated the fast support and urgency to make sure I felt my needs were met.", "Some of the cameras were defective, but the company promptly replaced them. Moreover, I\u2019ve tried many brands of cameras, but after getting the Aosu doorbell camera, I liked it so much I got one for my family. After that I got half a dozen of Aosu pan and tilt indoor. There were things in the user interface that I didn\u2019t like and the company responded to the feedback within one update. Everything I mentioned was added! I\u2019ve never met a company that actually implemented individual feedback. Usually the company collects a bunch of feedback and if enough people ask for the same thing, then they implement it eventually.  Aosu cameras have great quality. They have something other UI don\u2019t have, which is an indication of events on the playback track itself. You can jump to an event which is coloured in blue, or you can start recording before the event (but if you want to record the event with before and after make sure you start recording slightly before the event in blue otherwise it will record the event and say \u201cfile saved\u201d). The audio is great, however I don\u2019t ever use the family call button. I use the cameras on 5 GHz internet but the good thing is you can use both! Other cameras only use 2.4. The main reason I selected Aosu is the value = pan and tilt + 2K quality. Very good price for the features you get and the user interface is quite pleasant.  The customer service is always on the ball. You can message them through Amazon or through Aosu app and they always reply and resolve. I love that. No wonder I got half a dozen cameras from them!

Wyze used to be good however they have become increasingly greedy taking away things that they promised were for a lifetime. I decided to try a different brand and these AOSU cameras have been awesome. The app is very straightforward and easy to use and you can view your SD recorded moments at any time. Once in a blue moon the app tends to crash or I should say the camera feed crashes and doesn't connect and I have to force close the app and restart otherwise they have been rock solid without any issues regarding camera functionality.  I will definitely be replacing all my Wyze cameras with this brand going forward. My next purchase will be their outdoor solar panel motion capture cameras. No point having multiple cameras with multiple apps, I will stick with one brand and one app and definitely AOSU will be the one.

It\u2019s worked extremely well so far - my only complaint is that the motion detection is overly sensitive in some ways and not enough in others. It responds, for example, to changes in lighting, as when the sun emerges from behind a cloud, but doesn\u2019t respond well to a grey cat showing up after dark. We opted to err on the side of too many notifications, and left the motion sensitivity turned up high.  Oh, and the \u2018human detection\u2019 is kind of a joke - it\u2019s worked correctly exactly one (1) time, while frequently trying to tell us that cats or raccoons are human. But that\u2019s not a big deal, because it still detects the movement of humans.  We recently set up a second camera near another feeding station. It also performs well as a camera, but we\u2019re having increased issues with notifications. Most notably, we seem to get alerts that the new camera detected movement, when in fact it\u2019s actually the original camera. We have a third camera to set up, but now I\u2019m a little concerned about how confused the alerts will get if we do that.  We also seem to get a lot of alerts on the newer camera that I can find no reason for at all. Consequently I\u2019ve turned the sensitivity on the new camera way down, but that doesn\u2019t seem to have lowered the number of (seemingly) false alerts.  I still think these are a good value, and I have zero complaints about image clarity or overall camera quality. If you only have one set up, you probably won\u2019t have any issues.

These cameras are simply amazing! Not only do they come at an unbeatable price, but they also deliver exceptional performance.  First and foremost, the motion detection feature works flawlessly. It detects even the slightest movements, allowing me to receive timely notifications when my dogs are active. This feature has been invaluable in ensuring their safety and security.  The picture quality is outstanding as well. I was pleasantly surprised by how clear and crisp the images appear on the camera's feed. It provides a reliable visual of my dogs' activities, even in low-light conditions. The ability to see every detail gives me peace of mind when I'm away from home.  What sets these cameras apart is their versatility. I appreciate that they can be used both indoors and outdoors, making them perfect for monitoring not only my dogs inside the house but also the backyard. The cameras are durable and weatherproof, handling various environmental conditions with ease.  One significant advantage is the absence of a mandatory subscription. Unlike many other surveillance cameras on the market, these don't require an ongoing subscription fee. I have the freedom to choose whether I want to opt for additional features or not. This flexibility is a huge plus for me, as it allows me to tailor the cameras to my specific needs.  Overall, I highly recommend these cameras for pet owners or anyone in need of reliable home monitoring. The unbeatable price, exceptional motion detection, impressive picture quality, and the option to use them outdoors make these cameras a fantastic investment.

I will be recommending these little cameras to all my friends!", "We\u2019ve had one camera set up for several months to keep track of the stray/feral cats we feed. It\u2019s worked extremely well so far - my only complaint is that the motion detection is overly sensitive in some ways and not enough in others. It responds, for example, to changes in lighting, as when the sun emerges from behind a cloud, but doesn\u2019t respond well to a grey cat showing up after dark. We opted to err on the side of too many notifications, and left the motion sensitivity turned up high.  Oh, and the \u2018human detection\u2019 is kind of a joke - it\u2019s worked correctly exactly one (1) time, while frequently trying to tell us that cats or raccoons are human. But that\u2019s not a big deal, because it still detects the movement of humans.  We recently set up a second camera near another feeding station. It also performs well as a camera, but we\u2019re having increased issues with notifications. Most notably, we seem to get alerts that the new camera detected movement, when in fact it\u2019s actually the original camera. We have a third camera to set up, but now I\u2019m a little concerned about how confused the alerts will get if we do that.  We also seem to get a lot of alerts on the newer camera that I can find no reason for at all. Consequently I\u2019ve turned the sensitivity on the new camera way down, but that doesn\u2019t seem to have lowered the number of (seemingly) false alerts.  I still think these are a good value, and I have zero complaints about image clarity or overall camera quality. If you only have one set up, you probably won\u2019t have any issues.

These cameras are simply amazing! Not only do they come at an unbeatable price, but they also deliver exceptional performance.  First and foremost, the motion detection feature works flawlessly. It detects even the slightest movements, allowing me to receive timely notifications when my dogs are active. This feature has been invaluable in ensuring their safety and security.  The picture quality is outstanding as well. I was pleasantly surprised by how clear and crisp the images appear on the camera's feed. It provides a reliable visual of my dogs' activities, even in low-light conditions. The ability to see every detail gives me peace of mind when I'm away from home.  What sets these cameras apart is their versatility. I appreciate that they can be used both indoors and outdoors, making them perfect for monitoring not only my dogs inside the house but also the backyard. The cameras are durable and weatherproof, handling various environmental conditions with ease.  One significant advantage is the absence of a mandatory subscription. Unlike many other surveillance cameras on the market, these don't require an ongoing subscription fee. I have the freedom to choose whether I want to opt for additional features or not. This flexibility is a huge plus for me, as it allows me to tailor the cameras to my specific needs.  Overall, I highly recommend these cameras for pet owners or anyone in need of reliable home monitoring. The unbeatable price, exceptional motion detection, impressive picture quality, and the option to use them outdoors make these cameras a fantastic investment.

Setup was really not that hard at all. Just use the QR code from the instruction manual & it takes you right to the app to download. Just install it and make sure you connect everything to your 2.4 GHz WiFi only. This does not work with 5 GHz WiFi channel, so you may have to switch your phone to 2.4 if you normally use the 5 GHz. Otherwise though, pretty much everything worked fine.  I also have a Eufy video doorbell that I've used for nearly 7 months, and this one compares very nicely with it. All in all, I may still prefer some things in the Eufy Cam over this one, but hey, there's a pretty BIG price difference there too!  This came with about a 70% charge on it so it was plenty to get started with & do the set up etc.  The instructions were pretty good & there were quite a few settings that could be tweaked to your personal preference. The chime sound through the phone was a little weird & sort of slightly distorted or \"harsh\" sounding, but there were several different sounds you can choose from & I did not try them all so maybe others sound better.  Still, everything on this does work & work well. It alerts to motion fine. You can change the length it records to up to 60 seconds so it doesn't cut off too soon (Default record length is 15 seconds) It's easy to turn on or off & easy to reset it should you need to.  The videos are nice and clear & this actually comes with a nice brand name (SanDisk) 16GB Micro SD card INSTALLED.  My main dislike about this doorbell, is just that it's kind of large, tall really. It measures 6 & 5/8\" tall x 2 inches wide X 1 & 5/16\" depth. So if you were planning to use an Anti-theft Video Doorbell Mount for apartment doors and such so you wouldn't have to drill holes, then it may be hard to find one that fits this doorbell, height-wise. Otherwise, if you're mounting to your own home with the included bracket it should work fine.  But all the stuff works pretty well on this. Worth the price for sure. ...Some things in the app & playback may take a little figuring out. The included 16 GB SD card should last a long time since these types of cams use a very small but HQ file size for the vids. I put a 128 GB SD card in my Eufy doorbell cam 7 months ago, and it's only used about 8 GB of it so far with thousands of detections if that gives you any idea. ...So the included 16gb card with this one should last a LONG time I believe. There is a cloud storage option if you don't want to use local storage. But it does cost a few bucks. It's there though if you want it.  On battery it should last for several months before it needs charging. This is dependent on your record settings though. Longer recordings etc. will use more battery.

The ringer's volume, the ring type, and the length (number of rings) can be adjusted.  The camera module measures 6.25 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1.375 inches thick. The ringer module is 1 inch thick, 2 inches wide, and 3.25 inches long. The package comes with screws for attaching the doorbell camera mounting plate to wood, plaster, or stucco; double sided tape is also included to attach the bracket to a flat surface if you don't want to drill holes.  The doorbell camera recharges via the included standard USB-A to USB-C cable, but you will need your own AC adapter/USB charger. The ringer can be plugged into any AC outlet  Unfortunately, there was no instructions on how to use the app that you download onto your smartphone to set up features like motion detection and doing simple things like deleting all the notification/messages from the doorbell video camera. It took some trial and error to figure out how to use some of the features. There was a setting to toggle on/off the Alarm Linkage which I couldn't figure out how to use as there were no instructions.  The app does have a lot of features such as setting up a privacy area/zone so that the camera only looks at a particular area or to set a schedule for when the camera is active. You can also set it to not disturb you with notifications if your phone is in a Do Not Disturb mode.  You can set the doorbell to notify you of any motion it detected, or only upon pressing of the doorbell button. The motion detection alarm can detect motion up to about 30 feet away and so I can get notified when a UPS truck comes by my house or when the garbage truck comes by to pick up my trash (and I can then move the trash cans back in).  Another neat feature was that you can record a customized message that will play to the person ringing the doorbell, and that person has the option of leaving a verbal message that will be recorded by the doorbell camera. Furthermore, you can have a 2-way conversation to the person at the door via your smartphone (there is a speaker and mic on the doorbell camera).  The Litokam Doorbell Camera can be powered via it's built-in rechargeable battery or you can connect it to an existing pre-wired doorbell (and so not be dependent on having to recharge the built-in battery). The manual states that the built-in battery can run the video doorbell for up to 6 months. That's probably optimistic as I found that the power level goes down about 10% every week or so.  The door bell video can store its videos/images locally on an onboard micro SD card or you can subscribe to the cloud service to store the videos/images in the cloud (I didn't test that).  The image from the doorbell camera is very sharp and clear during the day and even into the evening. But when it gets real dark, I found that the IR night vision mode is not that great; there's not much contrast and the image was not clear.  What really kept me from rating this 5 stars is due to the app behavior. When trying to access the camera or view the video on the doorbell camera on my smartphone, I would often get a message: \"Failed to establish the encrypted channel(-3). Click to retry\". And I would have to keep retrying until it finally works. Sometimes I would have to close the app and retry. Another annoyance was that if I have the app open, and the doorbell is rung, there is no way to turn off the ringing notification on my smartphone easily; I have to go into the app to silence (hang up) the doorbell ringing. If I have the app closed, then pressing any button on my smartphone will silence the ringing just like with a normal phone alarm.  However, despite these issues, I do like the Litokam doorbell camera as it allows me to see who is at the door and I can speak to the person at the door without having to open the door. It also gives me peace of mind as I can see who came to my door even when I'm away. And finally, the camera can detect and notify me when a delivery is dropped off at my doorstep.

Easy installation and great customer service.", "Good door bell with the price and was easy to install and start up.", "Pros: Price, pan and tilt function, image quality.  Cons: App permissions, not sure I\u2019d be happy having this visible through my firewall.  This is a great little camera! Installing the phone app was straightforward, the only minor issue was that the camera model number didn\u2019t appear in the list of supported devices. However, it is pretty obvious which one to choose as there are pictures. I was a little concerned by the number of App Permissions needed to make it run namely, Location, Name, Email, User IDs, Address, Phone Number, Other, Purchase History (why?), Health and Fitness Info (why?), Photos and Videos (one of the few understandable ones), Audio, App Activity, App Info and Performance and Device / Other IDs.  Some of these are understandable but others just seem like a data grab. I know that\u2019s the way things are now but I\u2019m not happy about it.  I am a bit nervous of using Cloud connections with this camera as I don\u2019t know how secure it is. It can be used with Amazon Echo and Google Home platforms, and it uses an encrypted video stream so should, in theory, be safe to use. However, are the encryption keys secret? Does it use a hard-coded password? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d like more information to be made available and I\u2019d like it to be able to integrate with open-source smart home systems.  A couple of nice surprises when setting up; the camera speaks instructions which makes life simple, and it moved! I didn\u2019t even know there was a pan and tilt function when I ordered it. Nice.  I had it up and running in no time and was soon monitoring next door\u2019s cats jumping on my wheelie bins. Motion detecting is very sensitive and can pick up plants blowing in the wind but there\u2019re several settings that you can use to filter out unwanted detections such as sensitivity, activity area and human body filtering. These are quite advanced features for such a cheap camera.  Image quality is pretty good at this price point and there is a lot of control over how the image appears, including HDR. If this were used as a security camera, I think facial features would be recognisable. The supplied bracket is more than adequate as the camera is lightweight and compact.  All-in-all then, a useful bit of kit, I\u2019ll be using mine to monitor my rear garden with it being pointed out of my window. Read more", "I have owned a few of these types of cameras over the last few years, so I'm used to setting them up.  With this one you'll need another app to add to the long list which manufacturers seem to insist on. I'll never understand why they cannot create a single one which allows everything to be controlled on that.  Upon installing the app you'll be asked to give some significant permissions - I do not like this - but you can actually bypass them. Create an account (I use a burner email for devices, that way no sensitive information can be collected) then confirm in the app with the numbers you've just been emailed.  When it asks for your location, decline. It's not needed to control the camera. The app will then ask you to join your network, manually add it here, location on will scan for it but with it off you just type the actual WiFi hotspot. It needs to be 2.5ghz, it will not work on 5ghz when setting up. Once it connects to your network it will then ask you to scan the QR code on your phone via the camera lense, it takes around 30s and hay presto, you're done.  Once the camera is connected it will ask for more permissions. Ignore these and it will still work no issue.  The image produced by this camera is excellent and the functions work flawlessly within the app. The image is smooth and responds instantly with movement, you have all your usual functions and I have added screenshots of what you can do within the settings.  The camera has a decent amount of movement too which will cover a large distance and you can have the camera set to automatically follow. This is particularly good if you have pets and wish to keep an eye on them like I do.  It includes a wall mount which is pretty decent but I'll be using this on a counter top.  My only complaint is needing another app and the permissions needed. I do not like giving apps or companies access to info. Read more", "The camera setup was not complicated at all, and the connection has stayed stable ever since, so it is all very convenient. The item is compact, and has a power cable with a good length. The image in the phone app is pretty clear and I can aim the camera to somewhere else by simply dragging the picture on the touch screen. Now I am able to have a peak at my living room in full colour from anywhere and anytime, and even can talk to the people present and listen to their answer. But we don't use it for any of the above purposes. You see, my niece is a sweet little girl, but has a problem with controlling her temper. However, since Santa installed this camera in our home to help him decide if her name belongs on the Nice list, the dramatic meltdowns have stopped completely. The Little Elf follows the movements of people in the room, or sometimes it just gets stuck watching the telly with us, which makes her giggle at the expense of the elf on camera duty. Santa even talked to her through the camera just the other day, telling her what a great job she's doing and how much presents he's going to bring her in return. So yes, this product makes us very happy, and it works for us pretty well.", "This is Brilliant!! I wasn't expecting much from this in honesty, but this is actually great!  We've been using it as a baby monitor but it can do a lot more than standard camera. Picture quality is very good in both day and night mode. Also has 2 way audio which can be toggled on/off.  Comes with a lot of features straight away, not having to pay extra subscriptions etc (unless you want their cloud storage, which from looking at appears to be a lot cheaper than that offered by Ring) Easy to set up with the app. Couple of minutes before you have full control. Zoom and movement options included. Also comes with motion tracking which I thought would be a bit gimmicky but actually works surprisingly well!

It notifies my immediately if there is someone in the frame. The app is easy to use and accurate. Prices are not bad for storage on the app either.", "First off, I'm a Director of IT for a healthcare company, we have 17 sites in three cities all networked together flawlessly, and have worked in the It field for 25+ years, so this review is coming from a plethora of experience. This camera is poorly designed, I expected cheap (it was purchased to watch a dog), but the software, and camera design is inexcusable. First, the design flaw, the \"reset\" button is useless, it is under the camera \"orb\", between the bottom of the orb and the rotational housing/case. If you do not have 100% control over the camera, it cannot be reset, ever as it is \"at rest\" underneath the camera with a few mm space between the camera and the housing. Yet, in the set up instructions they say \" if you have trouble, reset the camera and try again\", which is impossible to do. The second thing is, The app you use to connect to the camera allows you to connect to the camera, but then uses some mystical \"audio transfer\" of your wireless configuration to the camera to complete the network set up. Rather than letting you enter your SSID/network name, and the password, your completely at the mercy of a poorly written API to work with a tone deaf camera. I've never heard of such nonsense in my life, and I've set up and manage a million dollar network for a living. If the API can communicate with the camera, there is no reason to not allow you to configure the camera for your wireless network, but there it is, you cant. Finally the app provided is faulty, it provides a wireless signal tester that's crap and downplays your wireless strength. Like I said I work in IT, I have many nifty apps on my phone for my job, including multiple paid apps to evaluate wireless signals, signal strength , channels etc, My wireless dual band router is 15' line of sight away from the mounting area, with nothing but open air between the two devices and the app claimed the network signal was horrible, while every other app I have has me at full bars, no Db loss and excellent transfer on both Bands.

When the package arrived, the sleek black Monitech camera was nestled snugly in the box. It looked so professional and compact. I could hardly wait to start snapping pictures and recording videos with it. Let me tell you, the image quality is chef's kiss. The 48MP sensor captures every detail and color beautifully. Whether I'm taking stunning landscape shots or close-ups of flowers, the results are consistently impressive. And the digital image stabilization keeps my shots steady, even when I'm on the move. The 52mm wide-angle lens expands the view to 120 degrees, perfect for capturing those epic landscapes. And the macro lens? It's great for close-up shots, like those droplets of morning dew on leaves. The level of detail is insane. The 180-degree rotatable 3\" touchscreen is a godsend for vloggers. I can see myself clearly while recording, and it's so helpful for framing pictures. No more awkward guesswork or needing someone else to take your picture. I can connect the camera to my computer via USB and use it for video chats and live streaming. Plus, when I want to watch my content on a larger screen, I can connect it to my HDTV with an HDMI cable (not included). It's so versatile, whether I'm filming at home or on the go. Oh, and the battery life is surprisingly good! The camera comes with two 1500 mAh Li-Ion batteries. Each battery lasts about 30-50 minutes, and the best part is, you can use the camera while it's charging. So, I can plug it into an AC adapter or even a power bank, and it just keeps going. Plus, there's an automatic shutdown feature, which helps conserve power. And the camera comes with a bonus 32GB TF card. No need to worry about buying extra memory \u2013 it's included.

It captures even the smallest details, from the patterns of a butterfly's wing to the subtle expressions of your loved ones. And if you're a vlogger like me, you'll love the 180\u00b0 flip screen.  The 16X digital zoom is also really impressive. I was able to get closer to distant objects without having to move an inch. And the 52mm wide-angle and macro lenses that come with the camera are the cherry on top. They're perfect for capturing landscapes or up-close shots.  Another great feature is the battery life. With two batteries included, you'll never have to worry about running out of juice during a shoot. And the autofocus is snappy and the flash is bright, making it easy to capture great shots even in low light or when shooting moving objects.  Overall, this camera is amazing.

It was difficult enough to get everything get things aligned while on a bench. My cellphone is large but not huge, and its weight just dominated the whole affair.  I got it mostly to get static views through the optic, so I may have a solution: move the scope forward enough to rig something behind the scope on the Pic rail to support the works.

This is the first one I've used that actually centered on the reticle and actually stayed in place as I moved my air rifle around. All the others were very loose and slid out of position with the slightest bump or movement.  Took me a couple of minutes to figure out the ideal way to set it up but once I did everything locked in place and held solidly as I moved around and took shots.  You have to fiddle around with the zoom on your phone to get it to match the zoom and parallax of the scope but once you do you can get a pretty clear photo. I was actually able to get it so the screen is perfectly aligned with the reticle. I was able to take several accurate shots while watching the screen instead of having my eye behind the scope.  The parts themselves aren't the most robust, the plastic clamp for the phone feels a bit flimsy, but works well enough. The part that slips over the eyepiece is aluminum, and the plastic screws anchor it well without scratching up your scope.  It's not perfect, but it's by far the best kit I've tried yet.

I had this camera for a good few months before i actually sat down and decided to see how everything worked. The camera in its entirety is actually pretty good for the price but of course it has its flaws.  I will say that this camera doesn\u2019t hook up to wifi for some reason. I\u2019ve tried looking for videos and everything but nothing worked. I feel like this camera is a different version than what other people on social media have but aside from the camera not hooking up to wifi or bluetooth, the camera is pretty good.  The basic settings are easy to change and everything! But i also wanna say that the color settings for when you\u2019re making a video is a bit frustrating.  Like i could be recording in my house in the daytime with the natural lighting and no camera flash on and if i have the screen color setting on \u201cauto\u201d, it would make me look rather pale/lifeless and make the room look gloomy rather than vibrant like how it would be outside. and then if i were to change the screen color setting to \u201csunny\u201d, it would make me look orange in the house (refer to the video) and still make outside look a vibrant. so the settings are rather confusing so i would definitely pay attention to that when making videos.  and lastly, i wanna say that you definitely are gonna need a good microphone. it sounds veryyyyy muffled without one. but honestly if you get the mic and have your camera settings set to your preference for taking vids/pics, you got yourself a great vlogging camera for under $100! WHO\u2019S GONNA BEAT THAT BRO??  overall, everything is pretty cool with this camera and i would get it as someone who doesn\u2019t wanna pay for a super great quality camera like Sony or Canon, especially considering that i\u2019m JUST starting to vlog and is trying to get the hang of things. :) Read more", "I brought this camera for my niece and she loves it.

This is the first one I've used that actually centered on the reticle and actually stayed in place as I moved my air rifle around. All the others were very loose and slid out of position with the slightest bump or movement.  Took me a couple of minutes to figure out the ideal way to set it up but once I did everything locked in place and held solidly as I moved around and took shots.  You have to fiddle around with the zoom on your phone to get it to match the zoom and parallax of the scope but once you do you can get a pretty clear photo. I was actually able to get it so the screen is perfectly aligned with the reticle. I was able to take several accurate shots while watching the screen instead of having my eye behind the scope.  The parts themselves aren't the most robust, the plastic clamp for the phone feels a bit flimsy, but works well enough. The part that slips over the eyepiece is aluminum, and the plastic screws anchor it well without scratching up your scope.  It's not perfect, but it's by far the best kit I've tried yet.

Video quality is much better than the bulb cameras I have. The only thing that I\u2019ve found is that when the battery gets low it disconnects from my Wi-Fi. Took me a couple of times to figure that out. The solar panel isn\u2019t the best thing because it doesn\u2019t fully charge the batteries. That became annoying fast. To solve this issue I ran a USB-C cable to it from a wall wart and haven\u2019t had any issues since. I bought a second one and I\u2019ll find out how strong the Wi-Fi signal is with it because it will be placed in my backyard. Will update after I get that one running. 13OCT23: update, I now have 2 of these cameras and when they are working they are great. They have a tendency to freeze frame about every 90 seconds or so. Then eventually my display will go black and it says to check network as if the internet has gone down. So I check my internet connection and it seems to be working fine. I know that my internet is questionable (Centurylink) so I\u2019m not using the cloud storage. Instead I\u2019m using a 64G SD card. I don\u2019t have it scheduled to record events, because on my old bulb camera I had to delete things every other day so it would stay on. This is a temporary set because I\u2019m renting now and don\u2019t want to install my wired camera system. Also I don\u2019t have Alexa so that might be the reason why I\u2019m having these issues. The video quality is exceptional even the nighttime color is great, the IR night vision is so that I can recognize someone if need be. I don\u2019t think that living in a mobile home would be an issue with the Wi-Fi @ 2.4 Ghz since it\u2019s only 15\u2019 away from the router and my other one is about 30\u2019 from the extender. My cordless phone is 2.4Ghz no issues with it outside. Wish it was compatible with my 5G Wi-Fi that works much better than the 2.4Ghz. After using it and figuring out the issues I will have to give it 4-4.5 stars overall. I would recommend it for people who don\u2019t live nor work in metal buildings or mobile homes. 15OCT23-Update II: updating again, still having issues with the camera freezing up and getting a network error. I have 2 cameras and they take turns dropping out. This morning the camera I have on my front gate dropped out 6 times in less than an hour. As I said before maybe it\u2019s the fact that I live in a mobile home and the metal is affecting it not sure. I don\u2019t have any issues with my Wi-Fi because I can walk down the road and still have my Wi-Fi service a block away (approx. 100 yards away). Also my cordless phone (2.4Ghz) works fine for the same distance. Guess I\u2019ll just go with the old fashioned way and use my wired cameras. Update #3: had the batteries charged up and plugged in the solar panel yesterday. Panel faces South and it had about 12 hours of sunlight. Sunset was about 1945 last night and sun rise was around 0655 this morning, so it was on battery power for about 11 hours. No video this morning (dead batteries). Plugged in to ac and waited a few minutes and it came back on. If and when I get my new cameras these are going back. Seems like Amazon has forgotten where I live, my first order of new cameras was sent back after it sat for a day or so about 60 miles down the road then they said it was undeliverable. Read more", " This is an updated review. My first camera didn't work as planned so I worked with the company to trouble-shoot the issues. I ended up sending in back. The company reached out and replaced it with another camera for me to try. The replacement camera worked as expected. Here my comments on quality.  Build: For the price, the quality of the camer is supberb. Nice large unit with lights, 2 antennas and a solar panel. Comes with charging cord. A 64gb MicroSD card worked in this unit the best. It is able to take 32gb-128gb. Just note, the larger card you get, the more battery it will take (finding & writing to sectors in a larger space).  Quality: The quality of the video is very good compared to some other models I've tried. I'm including a video I took in SD quality. I like to record lower quality to get better bandwidth, as my internet is moderate.  Setup: is extremely easy. Download the app, install the camera. Play around with the settings yourself, you'll learn it better. Just know that when you're setting it up, the voice on the camera is pretty loud.  Recording: You can record to Micro SD card only if you do not want to use their cloud service. I have slower internet, so I use it this way. It will record events 10s, 20s, 30s or continual. I wouldn't do continual though, because it IS a solar camera and it won't last you the night. I record at 20s, which gives me enough feed to see what's going on. You can also see LIVE view through the camera any time you want.  Placement: This camera comes with a mounting bracket and template, with a solar panel that has a nice long cable. You can mount it just about anywhere you want with the solar panel within 6' of the camera. Because it's solar, you do not need any other cords to plug it in, so you have more of a variety of places you can mount it. However, just know that it still needs wifi for you to be able to read your events.  Overall, I am giving this camera a 5-star review because customer service from this company was supberb. They helped with a problem, they helped make it right, and the replacement camera worked as expected, no problems. Customer service also kept in contact with me to make sure I had what I needed, and let me know they were there for me if I needed anything else.  If you are looking for a camera do place in an area you don't have power, give this one a try. You should be pleasantly satisfied with the results.

First off, I was pleasantly surprised by the packaging \u2013 it was sturdy and well-designed, which is always a good start.  One of the standout features of this camera is its super lightweight design, making it incredibly easy to carry around. This is perfect for on-the-go photography and vlogging. However, I ultimately decided to return it, not because of any flaws in the camera itself, but because I wanted a more high-end camera for my specific needs.  That being said, I must admit that this camera offers a lot of great features for its $100 price point. The 4K resolution and 48MP capability provide excellent image quality, and the 16X digital zoom allows for versatile framing options. I appreciated the inclusion of a 32GB Micro SD card and two batteries, which added to the overall value.  Additionally, the camera comes with a 52mm wide-angle lens and a macro lens, offering versatility for different types of photography. The manual focus option is a nice touch for those who prefer more control over their shots.  In summary, if you're a student or someone looking for a compact and budget-friendly camera with a good set of features, this camera is certainly worth considering. Its lightweight build and the included accessories make it a great option for beginners or those on a tight budget. However, if you're looking for top-tier performance, you may want to explore higher-end models.

I record with regular indoor lighting and this camera was able to record clear video at all the available resolutions, although I typically record at 1080p 30 fps to get best results without using a ton of memory space.  The menu is easy to navigate and even though the manual does not go much into depth for describing all the menu functions, I was able to search the web and watch YouTube videos to get a better understanding of the various menu functions. For the most part, I have been using the default menu settings except for Recording Resolution, which I set for 1080P 30fps and metering mode, which I set to Matrix Metering.  The internal microphone is adequate for recording voice audio from within a few feet from the camera, but it was not what I wanted for recording music. I initially had an issue with using external microphones. I contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in responding to my inquiries and helping me resolve my issue with using external microphones. I wanted to record from two speakers that were connected to my E-Drum Kit and connecting the microphones direct to the camera using a stereo Y splitter would not work, also I could not get regular external camera microphones to work either. However, the seller gave me the information I needed to get the right equipment to record the way I wanted to record.  The camera records audio in Mono (one channel) using a 3.5mm (1/8\u201d) TRS mic jack. The camera\u2019s mic input also needed to come from a powered mic source and the mic output must be in Mono. There are many battery powered mics to be found on Amazon. I decided to get a Comica CVM-AX1 mic mixer that can take a Stereo input from two mics and output to the camera in Mono. For my shotgun mic I got a Comica V30 PRO. Both of these mic solutions work great with this camera and each of these two items cost less than $50 each.  I also upgraded the memory card to a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card for around $15  All-in-all, even with these additional items I purchased, it cost a lot less than the $500~$600 price of a brand name camera.  I am happy with this purchase of the Wikico Camera. Read more", "This is exactly what I needed to take better pics of my crafts.

The gray for some reason even makes the cord look bigger than the EZVIZ but I put them side by side and to my disbelief they are about the same width. I also have gray walls in my main room but this gray cord on a white and black product just looks odd and makes the cord stand out.  Sound Both record sound well. Mics are in the front so remember to take off plastic cover of lens or your mic won\u2019t record incoming sound (I made this mistake initially). Outbound sound (you talking from your phone through the camera) is from a speaker in back on both.  Wall Mount EZVIZ mount is better. EZVIZ camera can mount to things that attract magnets like the refrigerator by just putting it against the refrigerator. If mounting to the wall, EZVIZ can stick and mount. It comes with a 3M type sticker for attaching wall mount to wall and then the magnetic metal base of camera attaches to the wall. You can literally put this up in the EZVIZ up in less than 5 minutes. The EZVIZ has the option to mount the wall mount with a screw as well for a stronger mount . Kasa has screw only option. Going back to aesthetics a little. If wall mounting downward from ceiling, the Kasa looks better because it has a shorter stem/neck that connects to the base making it closer to the ceiling and not oddly sticking out of the ceiling. If mounting vertically on a wall, the EZVIZ looks better . If sitting on table both easily sit but the square look of the Kasa/TP just looks odd and stands out in an unattractive way. However both are incredibly small so you can disguise them or remove attention from them by putting other things on your table.  Extra Features Kasa has the detection of people. While some EZVIZ cameras have this feature, the one I\u2019m comparing that is closest to this product from EZVIZ does not. The starlight feature isn\u2019t great on the Kasa but it does work. I expected it to work when it\u2019s dark and was disappointed, to see in the complete dark it functions like any other infrared camera. However when there is dim lighting, the Starlight feature does show the video in color . I had it side by side on my mantle next to the EZVIZ camera and as it approached evening and I only had one lamp in the room on. There was a noticeable difference. With that said, the Starlight Feature works. I could see my daughter in color on the Kasa but not on the EZVIZ. When it\u2019s completely dark, there\u2019s no difference between the two camera\u2019s display. Both have the option for zone targeted recording but I don\u2019t think this feature works well in either camera from my testing.  Connection: Both connect fairly easily if you are used to electronics and general technology of recent years. For someone not keen on technology, the EZVIZ connects easier and is recommended for seniors in my opinion. They simply scan a QR code with EZVIZ , it picks up their Wi-Fi signal automatically and they are all set! Not so simple with Kasa. For Kasa it prompted me to go change my phones Wi-Fi to join their network before it could pick up the network in my house and then allowed the connection the connection to begin. These extra steps might be frustrating for an older person if they don\u2019t have help setting it up.  Apps The Kasa app seems like it\u2019s a better view if you are comfortable with technology. It looks like the integration of smart home might be easier. I can\u2019t say for sure that it\u2019s easier because I don\u2019t have smart plugs and smart lights but the look of the app presents it in a more appealing way than the EZVIZ. However , the basic simplicity of the EZVIZ may be better for someone not as comfortable with technology. For example on the Kasa spot, I found that the place to view recordings on my SD is not the same viewing place for online recordings. I subscribed online and placed an SD in the Kasa camera and so it was confusing to find the videos in different places. initially but I figured that out in a few minutes. However, I think this can be confusing for someone not tech savvy or who lacks patience to play with the app. I'm testing these to buy for my parents also and I think the Kasa camera app might just be a bit too much for someone over 60 who isn't proactively staying up to date with technology. One downside of the Kasa app is that you can't give your family access to the cameras. The only workaround is to give everyone the same log in. With EZVIZ, you can send family members an invite to see your cameras from their phone. I like sharing the cameras with my entire family, we can leverage the 2 way talking features and , it makes us feel safer. Its like having an extra set of eyes on your house if there's ever a break in. I've had this feature on my Arlo account too. I think this is a miss for Kasa based on what I've read the workaround is to just give everyone the same log on. I think the problem with this workaround is you may have family members accidentally disabling cameras or intentionally disabling them to avoid notifications whereas you may want the notifications.  24/7 recording Both offer 24/7 recording to SD of 256 with no subscription  Subscription Subscription is optional with pricing about the same if you only have one camera but when you start considering cameras all over your house on cloud, then that's where the difference counts. 1 camera on Kasa $2.99/mo vs. $3.99/mo on EZVIZ. 4 cameras on EZVIZ $10.99/mo vs. 10 cameras on Kasa $9.99/mo. As you can see, if you are planning to do cloud for backup, with multiple cameras, you get better value with Kasa.  Recording in general You must have either a subscription or an SD installed for events to be stored in both. However in the EZVIZ it will create the event alert and still image on your app even if you don\u2019t have a subscription or an SD , you just won\u2019t be able to play back the video. This means with the EZVIZ you at least know there was an event even if you have no SD and no subscription. However knowing doesn\u2019t tell you more than that and so you will have to get an SD or subscription for both to work properly  Overall, it depends on what\u2019s important to you. I\u2019m typically drawn to aesthetics which leans me more in favor of EZVIZ but because the Kasa is priced only $10 more with the holidays it makes sense to take advantage of the 2K color. I\u2019ll add some EZVIZ in the bedrooms however. There\u2019s another TP link model branded under Tapo that is $5 less without Starlight sensor, seems like a good option too!  Overall both cameras are great for the price. It really depends on what is important to you. I'm actually considering doing a mix of both cameras. I don't mind having multiple apps and already had one old 360 EZVIZ camera that I love and use to use downstairs inside my home. Based on my research Kasa and EZVIZ can integrate both on an NVR and so this is no issue to me to mix cameras.  For reference, I also have Arlo cameras outside. The reason I started looking at other camera options is because my Arlo wire free camera batteries are no longer working. I can only turn the camera on when plugged into the wall and so this changes how I can use them outside or means a lot of workarounds. After trying to find aftermarket batteries and longer plugged wires since Arlo is not selling the 1st generation parts anymore, I started looking into hardwired cameras for outside. I also want to add some cameras for my parents. I figured I'd test the cheaper inside cameras for EZVIZ and Kasa to get a feel of their products more before investing into a new system outside and installing any in my parents home. I liked both so much that I decided to add more cameras inside of my own house since they are so affordable. Read more", "I have several other Kasa cameras with the pan and tilt function and have been very satisfied with them. I needed to add another camera and didn't need the pan/tilt option so I ordered this one. It was very easy to set up and connected to my existing Kasa app flawlessly. All of my Kasa cameras are managed in the same app. The image is great and the video is smooth. I can view live or recorded video from any camera online through the app. The night vision is great, except if you have it looking through a window you will get a reflection. In that case, go into the settings and turn the night vision off and the camera's low-light capability will be plenty sufficient to show you a good and clear black & white video. In the settings you have a great amount of options to control and limit many of the camera's functions. Definitely a great camera at a fantastic price. You will also need a class 10 micro sd card in order to save and view your recordings. A 16 GB card holds several days of recordings and automatically starts over.", "I like this simple, very affordable, user friendly camera so much! I travel a lot and worry about my pets while I\u2019m gone, so the camera is set up by their food/water dishes. It can be set to detect motion and alert you if you wish, so I can easily confirm they are ok. I\u2019m not very tech savvy, so this is a great camera for me. Setup is simple. You download the Kasa app, plug in the camera, then follow the in app instructions. If your device is having trouble locating the camera to add it, and you have followed all of the other directions, look under the \u201cWi Fi\u201d section. I bought a second one of these for my other house and it was slightly different to set up on my phone vs ipad. The picture quality is good, and set up is not intimidating!", "I loves the first one so much, I bought a second. They both are still going strong and doing great. SD card helps to save days of footage, the camera has a wide range, its sensitivity is adjstable and the picture quality is great. Its a great value for a pretty decent device for sure.", "These kasa cameras are excellent. A great value. I can't imagine why everyone doesn't use these in their house. They respond perfectly to commands in the app. The kasa app works very well. You can record intrusions. Excellent field of vision. A really nice product. And when combined with other kasa products, like the bluetooth plugs, you can go a long way to securing your house. Try these out. You will not be disappointed.", "Great camera for the price. I use it to monitor my front yard as I live in a high crime neighborhood. Has worked well sitting in my front window to deter criminals and capture video of potential intruders. Easy to install. Have recommended to several friends and they also love it!", "I bought this to use with google home, the nest hub. It times out after ten minutes which is not helpful as I wanted to use as baby monitor.", "Just great, replaced my Ring Cam as I could simply add an SD card and access the recordings that way. Quality is just as good if not a little brighter. No subscriptions are required!", "I already have several of these cameras and they work well, but this is the first one I've received with a Non-UK Power Supply / Plug. Very inconvenient! I was hoping they would have sorted out this by now. Reviews have been stating this for months. Needed this camera in a hurry, so I took a chance they might have corrected this by now, but no luck as of 12 Sept 2023.", "While the camera is decent and does the job why does it come with US power supply? Sure, it can be used with any USB supply and the provided cable will work with USB-A but either provide a locally useful power supply or don't provide any and say so.

Once in a blue moon the app tends to crash or I should say the camera feed crashes and doesn't connect and I have to force close the app and restart otherwise they have been rock solid without any issues regarding camera functionality.  I will definitely be replacing all my Wyze cameras with this brand going forward. My next purchase will be their outdoor solar panel motion capture cameras. No point having multiple cameras with multiple apps, I will stick with one brand and one app and definitely AOSU will be the one.

I just use to watch my dog and my staircase while I\u2019m gone.", "The blurams A31C Lumi Cam is yet another fantastic security camera from blurams. This model has added a call button that lights up bright enough to serve as a night light. The light can be turned off in settings if not needed. The pan and tilt feature is very quiet and the digital zoom remains relatively clear. It has the ability to generate a panorama and specific presets for quick access to different viewing angles. If power is lost to the camera, all settings are remembered when power returns. If power is on and internet goes down, the camera continues to record to an installed SD card. Super clear video day and night!  I see a lot of comments that mention the lack of 5 GHz Wi-Fi.  The 2.4 GHz frequency is best for security cameras in the majority of cases. This wavelength has a longer range and can penetrate solid objects more easily than the 5 GHz band, making it ideal for cameras that will be placed further away from the router.  The 2.4 GHz frequency supplies more than enough speed for these security cameras. The increased speed of 5 GHz is therefore not necessary.  The 2.4 GHz frequency is even more necessary for cameras like this one because, instead of a larger high gain external antenna, a small internal antenna is used to keep the camera as compact as possible.  Drones that have both 2.4 and 5 GHz capabilities will rarely use 5 GHz because of the much farther range the drone will fly with 2.4 GHz.  Even with the highly congested 2.4 gigahertz band, security cameras like this one will have more placement options, with better connectivity, using 2.4 gigahertz.  These are the main reasons why cameras like this do not include 5 GHz.  I see other comments that say this is not a wireless camera because it has to be plugged in to a power source.  The term \"wireless\" is used to reference the wireless Wi-Fi connection of the camera to the router. This is the most convenient way to set up security cameras since there is usually an outlet near by to power the camera but the router may be far away.  Some security cameras will use a LAN cable that links the camera to the router. This can limit the placement options of cameras because of the need to run LAN cables to the router.  Other security cameras have both Wi-Fi and LAN cable connection options.  No mater how the camera/router link is accomplished, Wi-Fi or LAN cable, the camera still has to be powered either by an internal or external battery, which has to be kept charged, or an AC power source.  I hope this explains some of the terminology used on security cameras. Read more", "I have 5 other blu rams cameras in a different model. I can hear this camera move which wakes me up in the night.

Ha una risoluzione 2k grazie ad un sensore da 3mega pixel.  Questa telecamera \u00e8 facile da installare visto che oltre il collegamento alla rete elettrica tramite il cavo microUsb (avrei preferito una cavo type-c pi\u00f9 moderno come tecnologia) bisogna scaricare soltanto l'app Blurams sui nostri smartphone (Android, iOS).  All'interno della confezione troviamo: - telecamera wifi - Cavetto micro usb con alimentatore. -Guida di installazione rapida -Tasselli  Una volta scaricata l'app sul nostro smartphone bisogna creare un account e connettersi all'hotspot WiFi a 2,4Ghz.  Una volta configurata possiamo vedere le immagini e l'audio in tempo reale nel nostro smartphone.  Una volta installata, via wifi posso dire che a risoluzione massima (2k) si vede bene. Se si ha una connessione non troppo veloce consiglio di impostare una risoluzione minore (la qualit\u00e0 si abbasser\u00e0 notevolmente) in modo da non avere fastidiosi caricamenti.  Dalle impostazioni possiamo attivare l'auto-Tracking e Rilevazione di movimento, comode quando non si \u00e8 a casa, la telecamera si attiver\u00e0 automaticamente segnalando l'intruso. La notifica di rilevamento movimento, in condizioni di rete buona, arriva pochissimi secondi dopo direttamente sullo smartphone. Aprendola ci verr\u00e0 presentato un breve video nel quale potremmo vedere l'intruso o chi ha creato l'allarme.  Tramite app sar\u00e0 sempre possibile vedere in tempo reale cosa succede ovunque noi siamo.  Durante la visione Live, dallo smartphone \u00e8 possibile parlare con chi si trova nelle vicinanze, e potremmo sentire pure quello che dicono grazie alla cassa e al microfono integrato.  Durante la visione live potremmo registrare quello che sta succedendo. Questa videocamera ha pure l'ingresso per una microSD che permette di registrare continuamente quello che succede.  \u00c8 motorizzata e tramite App potremmo gestire sia il movimento orizzontale di 360\u00b0 che quello verticale fino a 95\u00b0.  La visione notturna \u00e8 molto buona, grazie ai sensori ad infrarossi presenti intorno l'obbiettivo.  Molto comoda la funzione one touch, baster\u00e0 premere il pulsante con la cornetta posto alla base della videocamera per chiamare instantaneamente chi ha l'app installata nello smartphone (ideale in casi di emergenza o per comunicare qualcosa).  Il sensore PIR ha un'ottima sensibilit\u00e0 riuscendo a captare qualsiasi movimento. Un consiglio che posso dare \u00e8 di personalizzare il livello di sensibilit\u00e0 del sensore tramite app per non avere falsi allarmi.  La videocamera potremmo installarla ovunque, basta avere vicino una fonte di alimentazione e un segnale wifi.  Consiglio questa camera di sorveglianza a chiunque voglia guardare cosa sta succedendo all' interno della propria casa, tenere d'occhio il proprio cane, i nostri bimbi che giocano o essere avvisati tempestivamente tramite notifica di movimenti e rumori e anche di poter essere rintracciati subito tramite il pulsante one touch.  Ottima la risoluzione video, buono l' audio, app ben fatta, e possibilit\u00e0 di poter cambiare la visuale a nostro piacimento.  Il prezzo di quasi 50 euro lo trovo adeguato visto le funzioni e la qualit\u00e0, peccato solo la presenza del cavetto microUSB.

For the most part, I have been using the default menu settings except for Recording Resolution, which I set for 1080P 30fps and metering mode, which I set to Matrix Metering.  The internal microphone is adequate for recording voice audio from within a few feet from the camera, but it was not what I wanted for recording music. I initially had an issue with using external microphones. I contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in responding to my inquiries and helping me resolve my issue with using external microphones. I wanted to record from two speakers that were connected to my E-Drum Kit and connecting the microphones direct to the camera using a stereo Y splitter would not work, also I could not get regular external camera microphones to work either. However, the seller gave me the information I needed to get the right equipment to record the way I wanted to record.  The camera records audio in Mono (one channel) using a 3.5mm (1/8\u201d) TRS mic jack. The camera\u2019s mic input also needed to come from a powered mic source and the mic output must be in Mono. There are many battery powered mics to be found on Amazon. I decided to get a Comica CVM-AX1 mic mixer that can take a Stereo input from two mics and output to the camera in Mono. For my shotgun mic I got a Comica V30 PRO. Both of these mic solutions work great with this camera and each of these two items cost less than $50 each.  I also upgraded the memory card to a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card for around $15  All-in-all, even with these additional items I purchased, it cost a lot less than the $500~$600 price of a brand name camera.  I am happy with this purchase of the Wikico Camera. Read more", "This is exactly what I needed to take better pics of my crafts.

Once we showed him what to do, he picked it up in no time and took over 200 pictures on the first day! A lot of the other kids cameras I looked at had games on them and while this does have games, it has snake, Tetris, and a few games like that. I didn\u2019t want think to become another tablet-ish device, so I am glad they are just simple games that he doesn\u2019t have too much interest in and that aren\u2019t too distracting. We haven\u2019t uploaded the pics yet, but it appears easy enough to do. And the picture quality looks good too. The only slightly negative thing is that it is a lot smaller than I anticipated it to be, but it is good for small hands. I would say that it\u2019s maybe a tad small for my 4 year old\u2019s hands in that he could handle something a little bigger, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be hindering him. But I don\u2019t mind starting with this, letting him enjoy it, and then upgrading next year with something a little bigger/nicer if he continues to enjoy taking pictures.

One of the standout features of this camera is its super lightweight design, making it incredibly easy to carry around. This is perfect for on-the-go photography and vlogging.

Additionally, the camera comes with a 52mm wide-angle lens and a macro lens, offering versatility for different types of photography. The manual focus option is a nice touch for those who prefer more control over their shots.  In summary, if you're a student or someone looking for a compact and budget-friendly camera with a good set of features, this camera is certainly worth considering. Its lightweight build and the included accessories make it a great option for beginners or those on a tight budget. However, if you're looking for top-tier performance, you may want to explore higher-end models. Read more", "I bought this camera to record my drum practice sessions and I needed to buy at a budget price. This camera met my needs to perform this function.  I record with regular indoor lighting and this camera was able to record clear video at all the available resolutions, although I typically record at 1080p 30 fps to get best results without using a ton of memory space.  The menu is easy to navigate and even though the manual does not go much into depth for describing all the menu functions, I was able to search the web and watch YouTube videos to get a better understanding of the various menu functions. For the most part, I have been using the default menu settings except for Recording Resolution, which I set for 1080P 30fps and metering mode, which I set to Matrix Metering.  The internal microphone is adequate for recording voice audio from within a few feet from the camera, but it was not what I wanted for recording music. I initially had an issue with using external microphones. I contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in responding to my inquiries and helping me resolve my issue with using external microphones. I wanted to record from two speakers that were connected to my E-Drum Kit and connecting the microphones direct to the camera using a stereo Y splitter would not work, also I could not get regular external camera microphones to work either. However, the seller gave me the information I needed to get the right equipment to record the way I wanted to record.  The camera records audio in Mono (one channel) using a 3.5mm (1/8\u201d) TRS mic jack. The camera\u2019s mic input also needed to come from a powered mic source and the mic output must be in Mono. There are many battery powered mics to be found on Amazon. I decided to get a Comica CVM-AX1 mic mixer that can take a Stereo input from two mics and output to the camera in Mono. For my shotgun mic I got a Comica V30 PRO. Both of these mic solutions work great with this camera and each of these two items cost less than $50 each.  I also upgraded the memory card to a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card for around $15  All-in-all, even with these additional items I purchased, it cost a lot less than the $500~$600 price of a brand name camera.

They shipped July 16, 2023 and arrived July 17, 2023. They were packaged well. The enclosed instructions were difficult to read as the print was very small. Having said that, they were easy to install and had good built-in instructions from the CloudEdge software. The picture quality is very good, especially on the QHD mode. Night vision is good and with the spotlight, it is in color. They can be mounted with the lens up or down orientation as the picture can be flipped 180 degrees. They can record on a microSD card and have the ability for 1 to record to the Cloud either a free account or a paid version that has more capabilities. I had a few questions as to how to get them to perform the way I wanted so I sent an email to their support team. They try to respond within 24 hours. I sent my email at 4pm and had a response the next day at 6am (14 hour response). Their suggestions were helpful and were courteous. I didn't respond back to them and 2 days later I had a follow up email from them. Best customer service I've personally had in many years both in person, on the phone and the internet. They asked me to contact them anytime with further questions and I will. I'm very happy with the cameras, only surpassed by their support team. I would definitely recommend the cameras and seller. I've now had several more chances to contact them due to one of the cameras going offline after about 7 days. I received helpful troubleshooting information from them and I was unable to get the one to work to my satisfaction and they offered a free replacement. I received the replacement in 2 days (including Labor Day).

I love the solar panels, so my wife and I don't have to worry about replacing batteries for putting me cameras outside and having to run a power cord through the window. The solar panels are pretty small and we have them on the edge of the roof.  We have one outside in the front pointed at our cars and the street, and another one in the backyard pointing mainly at our shed.  Much better video than the old 720p cameras we had before. It has two-way sound, alert sound, a small floodlight that you can choose to go off every time motion is detected, and a text every time motion is detected. It's a great buy. I believe it is the best buy if you want solar panel outdoor video cameras with great features and good video and a great price!", "Great video/picture. Very clear and covers a large area. Sound is clear. Added features such as activating a siren and turning on the camera light are nice touches. Alerts come in timely. Mount very easily, have had this outside during numerous heavy rains now and no issues. Happy with the purchase:)", "This camera really does the job, at such a great low price! The installation was pretty much a breeze, just might depend from case to case how and where you install your cameras. I opted for a solar panel to charge my cameras, and they work very well! The quality is good and the features all work as advertised! The wireless setup process was pretty smooth. I\u2019d say motion detection works 90% of the time, i think it depends how you position your camera bc the instructions does state that tracking side to side works better than something approaching the camera head on. The app itself is also pretty good, pretty user friendly and easy to setup.

I recommend and feel it's worth the $$.", "Do you need a camera to monitor part of the house, the garage, the pets? Do you have a plug nearby? Then this camera is great. It's not the highest res, but 1080P is very clear and does a good job with night vision even though there are not a lot of IR lights around it. It has a decent amount of rotation and tilt to be able to monitor a pretty wide area.  Setup, was a little quirky. you first connect your phone to the cameras wifi. Then you set the camera to detect the home wifi router, putting in the 2.4ghz password. If that completes, you're pretty much on your way. If not, you have to repeat this step a couple of times, which happened to me. At first i wasn't too sure of the setup routine as it wouldn't complete the setup. Another irritation is, it will say your microsd car isn't useable. You need to use the tapo app to format the sd card once the phone app and camera are setup, and it should be fine. The phone app lets you take a picture, lets you record and stop recording. What i dont know yet, is it recording per schedule, or recording when you hit the record button while viewing? I will have to check into that, but you get a scheduler like most security cams, with normal recording schedule and motion schedule. It comes with a mount bracket to mount on wall or someplace. I just have it on a desk so i can point it down at where my dog sleeps. You can pan it around and the 1080p picture is clear in daylight and infrared at night. If the setup worked a little better i'd give this 5 stars because the price is great.  So if you need a small camera, that you can just place somewhere in the house in range of your 2.4ghz router, this works and was somewhat easy to set up. 4stars for now, but 5 star price.  i'm updating review since i just bought my 3rd tapo camera. So connection setup must have been fixed somewhat as i was able to set up on first try. It's still the same though as i mentioned above. What i didn't mention, is that there is a normal recording schedule which records continuously and a motion recoring schedule which only records when it detects movement. So when you go to play back you will only see snippets of recording if you only selected motion. They added a lot of features which requires some sort of subscription, like i do not use cloud, i dont like my home being stored online. I dont use advanced (subscribed) features like they can send you emails with snapshot for different triggers (movement, person, baby) but you will pay for this email service. It does have notifications though for free and it is just a text msg saying a detection happened, which is good enough for me. Also with other cameras you can filter sections of the screen out, that it wont trigger a notification. This works well unless you follow mode which the camera will try to follow the movement and then the filtered section will now filter areas you didn't want to. So take that into consideration. Still giving this a 5 for the price of the camera. Read more", "I got this camera to keep an eye on my cats when I'm out of town. I had a great opportunity to test it out when took a week long trip abroad. It worked perfectly! The night vision was actually really cool because of the time difference. Half the time I checked in to see if the cats were around, it was night time, so I was still able to see them. It has a pretty good range of motion. It allowed me to see almost the entire room that I set the camera in. And for my favorite feature, the voice function. I happened to catch a moment where I could see my cat planning to jump on the counters (which they're not allowed to do), and I used the microphone (keep in mind, I was in London and the cats were in Idaho, US) and I told the cat no, just like I would if I were home. He looked around to figure out where the voice came from and then thought about jumping up again, so I yelled again and he turned around and left the area!

I dont even need to go to my KASA app. to view my cameras in my Florida home, there. This TAPO camera is very good with a high quality picture, the only issue is that on the app, there is no opportunity for shutting down SPECIFIC notifications, such as people movement, noise, etc. so unless you go into the settings on your phone to shut down ALL notifications, you will get one movement notification after another on your phone. KASA is much easier to use in that it has settings to shut down specific notifications. However, I would recommend the TAPO camera, the price is good and it works well.

What an awesome company to listen to its customers and make adjustments! I can not wait to give an update on my new improved kodak H35N! The original H35 is great and I dont expect anything less from the new updated version. So Im changing my review to 4 stars for customer service and after using the camera I hope to change it to 5 \ud83d\ude0a  There is a but! So I have the first edition the ektar H35 and love it and the results. So I was so excited to get this one before they sold out! But!! Ok so first thoughts, the pink is not very pink, the flash control and filter is hard to turn on but the flash seems to charge much faster and looks brighter and isn\u2019t draining batteries. The sad news is that my 24exp roll of film refued to advance 3 times. 3 times I have had to take the camera into the dark and open the back to loosen the film so It could be advanced. I don\u2019t have the results of the. Images yet. But I do like the idea of the added features, the star filter and the bulb mode. I made sure to use all the features on my roll to see what this camera can do. I will try another roll and if it sticks as well I will be returning this one. This new edition does have an \u201ceasier\u201d loading method but I\u2019m wondering if that is what is causing the problem? I never had film stick in the first edition, ektar h35 no \u201cN\u201d. Maybe I just got a dud or there was a loading issue. So 3 stars because film sticks but it is compact and a fun camera.

One of the standout features of this camera is its super lightweight design, making it incredibly easy to carry around. This is perfect for on-the-go photography and vlogging. However, I ultimately decided to return it, not because of any flaws in the camera itself, but because I wanted a more high-end camera for my specific needs.  That being said, I must admit that this camera offers a lot of great features for its $100 price point. The 4K resolution and 48MP capability provide excellent image quality, and the 16X digital zoom allows for versatile framing options. I appreciated the inclusion of a 32GB Micro SD card and two batteries, which added to the overall value.  Additionally, the camera comes with a 52mm wide-angle lens and a macro lens, offering versatility for different types of photography. The manual focus option is a nice touch for those who prefer more control over their shots.  In summary, if you're a student or someone looking for a compact and budget-friendly camera with a good set of features, this camera is certainly worth considering. Its lightweight build and the included accessories make it a great option for beginners or those on a tight budget. However, if you're looking for top-tier performance, you may want to explore higher-end models. Read more", "I bought this camera to record my drum practice sessions and I needed to buy at a budget price. This camera met my needs to perform this function.  I record with regular indoor lighting and this camera was able to record clear video at all the available resolutions, although I typically record at 1080p 30 fps to get best results without using a ton of memory space.  The menu is easy to navigate and even though the manual does not go much into depth for describing all the menu functions, I was able to search the web and watch YouTube videos to get a better understanding of the various menu functions. For the most part, I have been using the default menu settings except for Recording Resolution, which I set for 1080P 30fps and metering mode, which I set to Matrix Metering.  The internal microphone is adequate for recording voice audio from within a few feet from the camera, but it was not what I wanted for recording music. I initially had an issue with using external microphones. I contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in responding to my inquiries and helping me resolve my issue with using external microphones. I wanted to record from two speakers that were connected to my E-Drum Kit and connecting the microphones direct to the camera using a stereo Y splitter would not work, also I could not get regular external camera microphones to work either. However, the seller gave me the information I needed to get the right equipment to record the way I wanted to record.  The camera records audio in Mono (one channel) using a 3.5mm (1/8\u201d) TRS mic jack. The camera\u2019s mic input also needed to come from a powered mic source and the mic output must be in Mono. There are many battery powered mics to be found on Amazon. I decided to get a Comica CVM-AX1 mic mixer that can take a Stereo input from two mics and output to the camera in Mono. For my shotgun mic I got a Comica V30 PRO. Both of these mic solutions work great with this camera and each of these two items cost less than $50 each.  I also upgraded the memory card to a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card for around $15  All-in-all, even with these additional items I purchased, it cost a lot less than the $500~$600 price of a brand name camera.

The 4K resolution makes me look all sharp and detailed, and whether it's a work meeting or a livestream, this webcam makes me look like a pro.  The PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) feature is like magic. I can adjust the camera angle and zoom in or out without getting up. It's a real lifesaver when I want to switch things up during a call or stream.  But here's the real star of the show: the AI-powered tracking. This webcam can follow me around, keeping me right in the center of the shot. It's like having a personal camera operator for my streams \u2013 seriously cool.  Setting it up is a breeze, and it works with all the major video software I have used. Plus, it's compact, so it doesn't hog my desk space.  The built-in mic does a decent job, but for the best sound, I'd still recommend an external mic. That's a minor hiccup considering how awesome the video quality is.  In a nutshell, the OBSBOT Tiny PTZ 4K Webcam is a must-have for anyone who wants top-notch video quality for work calls or streaming. It's like a pro-level upgrade for your setup that's surprisingly easy to use. I'm loving it! Read more", "I lost the 4K 60 fps after the firmware upgrade", "Because the 4K resolution produces images that are both clear and vivid, it is ideal for video conferencing, live streaming, and the development of new material. This camera guarantees that every detail is captured with incredible clarity, whether I'm on a Zoom chat with coworkers or generating material for my YouTube channel. The tracking and auto-focus capabilities enabled by AI are two of the most impressive aspects of this camera. It is quite similar to having a personal camera already installed on the device. No matter how much I move about, the camera is able to follow my motions and keep me on the screen thanks to its clever tracking capabilities. This comes in very handy during presentations and video conferences, when I want to seem professional but don't want to have to modify the camera angle all the time. Even if I move around or if there are numerous individuals in the picture, the auto-focus can keep everything in perfect focus because of its lightning-fast speed and pinpoint accuracy. The quality of my video footage as well as the quality of my online meetings have been greatly enhanced by this function alone. Another fantastic improvement is that there are now twin omnidirectional microphones included. The recording quality is excellent, and it captures my speech with an impressive degree of precision while simultaneously reducing the amount of ambient noise. Because of this, the audio quality of my video conversations and recordings has greatly improved, and I am now able to talk successfully without the assistance of an additional microphone.

I have a 1200 square foot gym split up into two separate rooms with a division in between. I have a 55\" screen that can be seen in both rooms at around 90% from anywhere, but my Logitech 4k camera cannot see everything clearly from one location. In order for a stationary webcam to do with this camera does, you have to move it manually when you move from one room to the other, major pain, especially when you're in the middle of training intensely.  The whole purpose of the setup is to be able to train with my trainer working remotely. I tried several different spots with with the Logitech 4K stationary cam, but nothing worked. And those cams don't have automatic zoom, or gesture driven zoom. They are similarly priced to this one but video quality is not quite as good.  I installed this camera, set up motion tracking and hand gestures for zoom, as well as my maximum desired zoom level, and it gets me everywhere on every single machine during every exercise. Using the motion tracking feature, which is one of three ways to have the camera track you as you move, is as slick as having a camera man there. It's continuously moving subtly while it's tracking you.  The only other option was running an app that would allow me to run two cameras, and even that wouldn't work as well as this, not to mention that it's a nightmare trying to get webcam apps to run more than one camera at a time. This was the perfect solution, with no caveats. I tested it using the camera app in Windows, and I used it in Skype for my training.  I used the USB 3.0 port, as that's all that's available to me on that particular PC, and this thing runs at 4K perfectly on a 10-foot cable. I've never seen a webcam with all this functionality at a price even close to this, and it does everything it purports to do, perfectly. I wish my security cams would do with this camera does!

First off, I was pleasantly surprised by the packaging \u2013 it was sturdy and well-designed, which is always a good start.  One of the standout features of this camera is its super lightweight design, making it incredibly easy to carry around. This is perfect for on-the-go photography and vlogging. However, I ultimately decided to return it, not because of any flaws in the camera itself, but because I wanted a more high-end camera for my specific needs.  That being said, I must admit that this camera offers a lot of great features for its $100 price point. The 4K resolution and 48MP capability provide excellent image quality, and the 16X digital zoom allows for versatile framing options. I appreciated the inclusion of a 32GB Micro SD card and two batteries, which added to the overall value.  Additionally, the camera comes with a 52mm wide-angle lens and a macro lens, offering versatility for different types of photography. The manual focus option is a nice touch for those who prefer more control over their shots.  In summary, if you're a student or someone looking for a compact and budget-friendly camera with a good set of features, this camera is certainly worth considering. Its lightweight build and the included accessories make it a great option for beginners or those on a tight budget. However, if you're looking for top-tier performance, you may want to explore higher-end models.

I record with regular indoor lighting and this camera was able to record clear video at all the available resolutions, although I typically record at 1080p 30 fps to get best results without using a ton of memory space.  The menu is easy to navigate and even though the manual does not go much into depth for describing all the menu functions, I was able to search the web and watch YouTube videos to get a better understanding of the various menu functions. For the most part, I have been using the default menu settings except for Recording Resolution, which I set for 1080P 30fps and metering mode, which I set to Matrix Metering.  The internal microphone is adequate for recording voice audio from within a few feet from the camera, but it was not what I wanted for recording music. I initially had an issue with using external microphones. I contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in responding to my inquiries and helping me resolve my issue with using external microphones. I wanted to record from two speakers that were connected to my E-Drum Kit and connecting the microphones direct to the camera using a stereo Y splitter would not work, also I could not get regular external camera microphones to work either. However, the seller gave me the information I needed to get the right equipment to record the way I wanted to record.  The camera records audio in Mono (one channel) using a 3.5mm (1/8\u201d) TRS mic jack. The camera\u2019s mic input also needed to come from a powered mic source and the mic output must be in Mono. There are many battery powered mics to be found on Amazon. I decided to get a Comica CVM-AX1 mic mixer that can take a Stereo input from two mics and output to the camera in Mono. For my shotgun mic I got a Comica V30 PRO. Both of these mic solutions work great with this camera and each of these two items cost less than $50 each.  I also upgraded the memory card to a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card for around $15  All-in-all, even with these additional items I purchased, it cost a lot less than the $500~$600 price of a brand name camera.

The antennas receive the wifi signal good enough to use full function of the cameras and allow me to check activity from anywhere I am.", "I own many EzViz cameras(13) and for some reason they cannot design an outdoor WiFi camera that has any sort of range. Their tiny indoor WiFi cameras, of which I own 6, all have much better range and connection stability. I have one of those in my shed window(inside), probably 80 feet from my house, and it's works great. Over the last few years I've bought multiple iterations of their outdoor cameras starting with the \"Husky\" then to the newer version of the Husky and now these pan/tilt cameras. These are an all new design with external antennas, so I had had high hopes that they had improved the WiFi, but no, these are as bad and maybe worse than all their previous outdoor WiFi cams. A little background; I have the latest Google Nest mesh router system in my house, there is literally coverage everywhere, and 800Mbps internet. When I take my dog for a walk my phone stays connected to my WiFi for 150' down the street. All 3 of these new cams are mounted to the side of my house, and all of them are no more than 15' from one of the mesh router nodes. Two of them only have to transmit through one exterior wall, the other transmits through one exterior and one interior wall. Overall I'd say these connect with the app less than 50% of the time, sometimes an entire day will go by and they won't connect. And when they do connect and you get a picture it's usually unstable and pixilated, and then just drops out completely. Once again, this isn't an isolated incident, I bought THREE of these and they're all the same amount of sh!tty, just like their outdoor camera predecessors.

A couple issues I have though, which I can deal with or remedy. Mine is mounted on the corner of house and the downspout is directly in front of it. If I have it facing that direction at night with NV IR light on it lights up the downspout so bright that it washes out everything behind it. I had to get black felt and lay it along the downspout so it didn't have the reflection.  Other issue is the mic. Even a small breeze sounds like loud static interference. Like it does when you blow into a microphone. So if it were windy and you were trying to listen to what people are saying you wouldn't be able to hear them over the wind noise. I'll try and find the mic location to see if I can tape foam over it or something...  Other than those 2 issues it's a amazing.

I have two of them set up to observe my pets while we are away on vacations or long outings, and they work just fine. Even at night, the picture is still clear enough to see what's going on. This camera does have a motion detection feature, but be aware that it is not a continuous video once motion is detected, but instead a screenshot and a message notifying the user that there has been movement. The picture quality is not like an HDTV, nor would you expect that from a camera system so moderately priced, but the overall quality is still more than good enough to observe what is going on in the area where you have set it up. The speaker system works well, as you can both speak and be heard through it. Once again, it should be noted that this is not an expensive home security system and therefore expectations should not be unreasonable. For the moderate price, you get a good and reliable camera system, and if your needs are simple this will work just fine for you. I am happy with the system and plan to add one more camera.

I think its a great value.", "MUBVIEW Baby Monitor with Camera and Audio. Let's start the review with an overall design. I love the look and the feel of it. Little elegant looking camera that looks like a furniture accent, blends well with the interior. Good quality device.Comes with instructions, a mounting bracket and screws, and a USB/AC plug.  One could stand it on a surface or screw to the ceiling upside down (in the settings you would need to flip the screen). The electrical cable is relatively somewhat short, but since it's a USB, you could potentially get an extension USB cable (not included). This camera must be plugged in at all times to function.  The quality of the still images is superb, even in night mode, and the live feed is very good. You can select between qualities of the pictures, but keep in mind it will consume your SD card faster at HD images. The two way audio is good quality, you need to press a mike button on your phone, to speak, but the camera speaker is always on. There is a bit of a lag in audio/video, but that is normal from my experience. You could make screenshots and instantly share them, which is very convenient. You can zoom with your fingers off the screen. Remotely controlling the camera is easy, and effective, it rotates almost full circle, and has a good range top to bottom. If installed right, the camera can overlook the entire room on its own. Great peripheral field of view. Also of note the night mode takes pictures and has a live feed in black and white, versus daytime is in colour.  I couldn't find the sd card slot initially, its hidden behind the lens, you would have to roll the lens all the way up (see the pictures). Unfortunately The sd card is not included, so i could not test it with it, i would have to buy one later. The installation is fairly straightforward, you download the app, and follow the instruction wizard, register, connect and you are good to go. Plenty of languages for your interface to chose from (see pics).  Motion detection works well (i turned it off because every time the dog walks by it sends you a message, which is good if you need this working well). Easy access from the app to the live feed, no authentication needed, which on certain products is quite annoying.  The recording and data storage available in 2 options: SD card, or cloud storage. The amazon product description ad mentions a free 7 day loop recording storage cloud, but all i could find is an offer for a subscription, I will be calling the customer service to verify this information, because it is a little confusing (see pictures).

This camera is wireless and runs on a battery making this easy to mount and setup almost anywhere - just be sure you have Wi-Fi in the area you are planning to mount this. I did charge the battery out of the box before setting up and it did take a little while to fully charge, so just be aware.

This camera does have AI and during my initial use, it is doing a good job differentiating between cars, people, pets, and packages.  The app is nicely setup and is very easy to use and figure out. In fact, I really like their app compared to other security camera companies in this price point. You can download the photos/videos to your phone/tablet and have access to all the settings of the camera. This can be done anywhere you have an internet connection.  All things considered, this is a really nice outdoor security camera that does the job very well. I wasn't too sure about this brand at first, however, I was pleasantly surprised! Read more", " This is a fairly compact battery operated security camera. It is heavier than it looks probably due to the battery it packed.  Setup require to download the Lindo app and registration is required like most cloud based cameras. Once done with registration, adding the camera is easy as it uses Bluetooth to connect to the app to pass all the required information like WiFi to the camera.  The image quality for both day and nighttime are very good. For a well lighted area, it maintains color image fairly well. It will switch to B&W mode with lighting is dim or you can set to switch one the spotlight LED to maintain color image but that will drain the battery much faster.  While the image quality is excellent and the battery is long lasting, there are a few things one should be aware.  o There is no slot for Micro SD card and it does not specify how much internal memory it has. It is very much cloud based camera. The cloud has free and paid options.  o Since it is only cloud based, if there is an internet outage, even your household WiFi network still working, you will not be able to access the camera. Like other cloud devices, this one has a time delay in getting the image stream or notifications. Depends on your ISP and the internet traffic, I have noticed this delay can be from a few seconds to over one minute. I have also come across a problem that the cloud server returned with an empty event list while just seconds earlier it has returned with a full list of events.  o In order to save battery, it uses PIR sensor to detect motion and then trigger the camera to record the event. Depends on how fast the subject is moving, it may only capture a second or two of the subjects or missed it altogether. Furthermore, depends on the lighting conditions, I have noticed very often the first second or two of the recording or live viewing, the image was overexposed before the camera adjust to the correct exposure. The combination of the overexposure and time delay may cause the subject on the recording not identifiable.  o While it can detect motion moving across its field of view fairly well, it has problem detect motion towards or away from it unless the object is very large or fairly close to it.  o Even it has a long lasting battery, unless you connect a solar panel to it, it needs to be recharged soon or later. Since the battery is not removable, you either have to take it down or bring a portable charger to it. Something to consider when choosing placement location. Read more", " Absolutely an amazing surveillance camera. I can't praise it enough. It has exceeded all my expectations I'm planning on purchasing 2 more and that says a lot. There are several things that I love about this product. I will break down each thing in this review.  Design: The design is amazing, it looks so elegant and premium. It seems like a product Apple would make. It's all white with a front glass finish. It looks great in any home and due to the 365-day battery on a single charge; (which I will elaborate more on) no cables are hanging from the wall, so it looks great in any home.  Features: I will start with my favorite feature that I didn't know I was going to love as much as I do; the 365-day battery on a single charge of 3 hours. Once you charge this camera for the first time, you just set it and forget it until the end of the year. No cables, no solar panel and no hassle. Also, the Lindo Life app hasn't failed me yet, not even once. No crashes or no glitches; just a smooth experience. In the App you gave several options, you can turn on the integrated light, which I would like to add is bright. You can set it to night mode or coloured by turning on the light. The motion detection works flawlessly, I left the motion detection on in my sons' room and each time they entered, I got an alert without fail. I can record and capture moments. Each event automatically gets set to my even tab. I can turn on the alarm and so much more.  Installation: this was a seamless experience; I have had several cameras in the past and never was it this easy to set up. You charge the device, download the app, set the wifi connection and connect with your phone. That is it, after that, you mount the camera with the screws, and drywall ankers that are included with the wall mount and you are done. It's that easy.  I got this camera to place in the front door of my house but my wife convinced me to place it in my sons' room to keep an eye on them when we are upstairs. This ended up working perfectly for that scenario because once I charged it and placed it, there were no wires for them to pull at. I can keep an eye on them and talk to them in my room instead of going down to theirs. I'm so impressed with this that I'm ordering 2 more for the front of my house soon. I tried using the camera while I was away and it worked perfectly, better than I had expected.  As I have previously said, I'm more than impressed with this camera and the experience I've had with it so far. The set it forget it part is so useful that I didn't know I was going to love it as much as I do. After a year, you charge them up and your good for a long while. I don't need to worry about cable management or finding a good spot for solar panels. It's simple, easy and efficient. The only feature that you will not have will be a remote turning of the camera, which based on the long-term use of the battery is completely understandable. The camera is a wide-angle camera so it captures everything. I'm just really happy with this camera and my must-have recommendation to all my family and friends. \ud83d\udc4d Read more", "This security camera by Lindo comes with everything you'll need, except for a screwdriver and device to load the app onto. It charges with the supplied USB C - C charge wire. And of course it comes with the mounting hardware and screws.  Installation is very simple. Attached the mounting plate with 2 of the 3 supplied screws, then slide on the swivel head with the camera attached. And that's it.  Instructions for use and set up are very good. The supplied instructions give you the basics to get onto the app. It is in the app where everything else gets done.  The app is called Lindo Life and there is a QR code in the instructions to scan to download. I just went to my app store to get it.  So the first thing the app will do is connect to the cameras by Bluetooth. From there you will need to set up the connection to your WiFi with a password. The instructions say to keep the camera within 20 feet of your router or you may need a repeater in between. I have my camera 40+ feet from my router and I am not using a repeater. The only signal problem I am experiencing is a delay, which I had when the camera was 5 feet from the router. It appears the video signal doesn't go straight to your device, rather it gets sent out to the cloud to be redirected back to your device. There is a considerable amount of delay, but this may be due to my internet, it has a DSL rate of upload which isn't fast at all.  For an added price you can get features like Privacy Zone so your neighbours don't get recorded. Or you can pay for more cloud storage with longer than 10 second videos. Personally I think a 10 second video can be quite adequate and it is wonderful it is provided for free, unlike some other cameras I've reviewed.  The video quality is pretty good. I'm not displaying it on my large TV so checking quality is being done from my cell phones screen. You can use 2 fingers to zoom in on the video and when zoomed in the quality was still pretty good.  There are different sensitivity settings. Each setting has its own battery drain level. If you want the battery to last a year, you'll have to minimize all the settings. I have mine set medium to low sensitivities so time will tell what that does to the battery.  From the app you can listen and talk through the camera. There is an alert siren you can activate, take pictures and record videos. And no, it appears there is no internal storage in the camera. It's all cloud storage.  The night vision has the option of recording in black and white with IR lights, or the visible white light can be on for colour recordings. Or you can chose no night time recording.  The app also provides a nice snooze feature. It can be set for 45 minutes, 2 hours, 5 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours. This way if you have activity where recording isn't necessary, and you want to conserve the battery, setting the snooze timer does this.  I haven't found an issue with this security camera, except for it being so internet dependant. For that reason, which is what causes the delay when at home sitting next to the router, I am giving 4/5 stars. Developers, when I'm home the live stream should be going straight to my device, not the cloud storage complex then back to my device! Read more", "This is a compact, easily mountable security camera with great quality photo and video capture, fast PD USB-C charging and exceptional battery life. In addition to capturing photo and video it also has a bright spotlight and a very loud siren to alert and warn potential intruders to go away. To further enhance its feature set it is also compatible with Alexa and is IP67 waterproof. There is a lot of power and features pack inside this relatively small package. It comes with a base that can be easily attached to a wall, post, etc. and then the camera mount is quickly and easily attached for use and detached from the mount for periodic charging. With the extended battery life charging will not happen often. If you prefer you it is also compatible with solar chargers (additional purchase). In use this was easy to setup and connect the accompanying app and then to my home WiFi network. All the features and controls worked via the app and I had no issues changing settings, speak through the built-in speaker, start and stop the alarm, etc. All easy and seamless tasks. The 2K camera produces very nice phot and videos during daylight and also has nice quality (full color or BnW) night captures. Overall a feature-packed, small package that delivers great results at a nice price point. I would recommend this camera.", "Review for: \"Lindo Intelligent Spotlight Camera 2K, Panda Color, 600 Lumens Spotlight, 365-Day Battery Life, PD Fast Charging, IP67 Waterproof\"  This package comes with the camera, mount, USB-C to USB-C cable, 3 screws and 3 anchors, a sticker for drilling precision, and the User manual.  The camera is rated to IP67 which means it is dust-proof and is protected against the effects of temporary immersion in water. It should be fine in the rain.  The camera itself has a decent field of view, and has multiple motion distance settings on the app.  The \"Lindo Life\" app has over 1K downloads, but no reviews yet.  Sometimes the camera records and sometimes it doesn't. It seems when the app is on, it doesn't record the event. Other times someone comes to my door and I look at the app later, and there is no recording. The events that are recorded are only 10 seconds long, so sometimes the main part is missed. For instance, the first 10s a person is on your property is recorded, and the last 10s, but not the time in between where they actually steal from you.  The events aren't immediate so the notification tells you that someone was at your door 2-5 minutes ago which isn't very helpful. We have driveway alarms so I wanted to be able to check the camera on the phone when the alarm went off to see who was on the property or if it was just the neighbour. But with this app, I can't see right away who it was. A while later, my phone will notify me that someone was here.  If the app is on when someone is there, you can use the spotlight, alarm sound, or speak to the person, and be able to hear them as well. There is also the option of taking a picture or video at that time, but it is not automatic.  There is an option to pay for the Plus Plan subscription service to be able to capture 60 second events, and save events for up to 30 days. It also records and stores events during power and network outages, enables privacy and activity zones, and gives notifications via text with thumbnails. This service costs $7.29 CAD monthly or $72.99 CAD yearly but they offer discounts from time to time.  I am giving the camera 3 stars because I only have 10 second event recordings when they are actually recorded, the notifications are late, and the other options are subscription-locked.

The quality of the still images is superb, even in night mode, and the live feed is very good. You can select between qualities of the pictures, but keep in mind it will consume your SD card faster at HD images. The two way audio is good quality, you need to press a mike button on your phone, to speak, but the camera speaker is always on. There is a bit of a lag in audio/video, but that is normal from my experience. You could make screenshots and instantly share them, which is very convenient. You can zoom with your fingers off the screen. Remotely controlling the camera is easy, and effective, it rotates almost full circle, and has a good range top to bottom. If installed right, the camera can overlook the entire room on its own. Great peripheral field of view. Also of note the night mode takes pictures and has a live feed in black and white, versus daytime is in colour.  I couldn't find the sd card slot initially, its hidden behind the lens, you would have to roll the lens all the way up (see the pictures). Unfortunately The sd card is not included, so i could not test it with it, i would have to buy one later. The installation is fairly straightforward, you download the app, and follow the instruction wizard, register, connect and you are good to go. Plenty of languages for your interface to chose from (see pics).  Motion detection works well (i turned it off because every time the dog walks by it sends you a message, which is good if you need this working well). Easy access from the app to the live feed, no authentication needed, which on certain products is quite annoying.  The recording and data storage available in 2 options: SD card, or cloud storage. The amazon product description ad mentions a free 7 day loop recording storage cloud, but all i could find is an offer for a subscription, I will be calling the customer service to verify this information, because it is a little confusing (see pictures).  Overall we are very satisfied with the product, its priced fair, and performs well. 5/5 Read more", "Wir haben uns f\u00fcr zwei dieser Kameras entschieden, um unseren Hund in unserer Abwesenheit beobachten zu k\u00f6nnen.

It was pretty easy to set up when you follow the instructions and the video quality is also good (both day time and night vision). The one thing that I would note (and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that is does not come with an SD card which you need for storage. If you don't use an SD card, you'll have to sign up for cloud storage which has a subscription cost.

I was planning on making an upgrade, but not for $25/mo per set up. I spent considerable time reviewing other options and decided these cameras may be a good replacement. So far I am happy with my purchase - so happy I replaced another one of my other Arlo systems with the same package. Some pros and cons:  Pros - simple to set up. Up, mounted and running in less than an hour - solar works great to keep them charged, even thru a window - Mounted my second system in the afternoon and the solar panels easily recharged the brand new out of box cameras at 75% to 100% in a few afternoon hours. - while I miss my cloud service, the internet accessible phone system works really well, as good if not better than Arlo. - I like the wide screen view, allows me to pick up more space - I also like the ability to dial in the detection zone with no extra fees - One concern I had was distance from the home base. My shop building is 110 feet from my two story house and no issues with the distance. Probably close to the max distance - Cameras are clear, better than my Arlo system. - Cameras work in zero to subzero weather unlike Arlo.  Cons - wish there was a PC based way to access the cameras - cameras are a little bigger than Arlo and not quite as compact - miss the magnetic mounts of Arlo, those were nice to mount and adjust - but not a deal killer - would be nice to be able to better adjust the cord length. Nice to have the cord length in some cases, more problematic when the camera and solar are close together. - simplify the various settings. A bit more complicated to make adjustments.  Good system, I like it obviously because I bought a second system. I'll update this review if I have more pros or cons. Sorry Arlo, make better business decisions next time. Read more", "I have been using my AOSU Security Cameras for almost 6 months. I previously had Arlo cameras for over 2 years, but got tired of changing the batteries and paying for the required monthly service to view footage. These AOSU cameras were very easy and quick to install. The day and night images are excellent and the security videos are instantly stored in the included storage device that plugs into router. These cameras always show 100% charge with the plug in included solar panels, and there's no need to replace batteries. The cameras also have sound and microphones, and the system includes a loud alarm siren if needed. The zoom is awesome on my cell phone, and can also watch or record live video anytime. I Love my AUSO camera system and the quality is way better and videos are more clear and wider. The night vision is also much better. I wish I hadn't waisted so much money and fees on the Arlo system.", "Easy to install! It works great in HD view! Sometimes the solar panels do not want to work, but the battery is durable, so it is not like you need them all the time. Personally, I think the cameras are great.", "The product setup is about as plug and play as you could ask for, set up the base, turn on the cameras, no technical challenges.  It took me about 2-2 1/2 hour after the cameras charged to install the system, and most of this was deciding placement.  If you want to save your data, there is an additional $269.99 for a 5 device cloud storage service, but for me it seems worthwhile unless you know your home base cannot be stolen\u2026  The price structure goes from 3 devices annually to 5 devices, even though the system is limited to 4, a bit of company pricing magic I guess.  The app is easy to use and has quite a suite of options, the video quality is very good, and the night vision is awesome!  I\u2019m on my first day/night and very happy so far, more to come as time and trial goes by! Read more", "I gave this system a 4 across the board just because I've never had any previous security system experience. That being said my intended use was amusement for my wife and it has been fantastic. Picture quality is good day or night , the viewing angle is great and Im pleasantly surprised at the wifi range. Our wireless system is very fast but the range has been anemic. I was anticipating upgrading to a mesh router system eventually and I was pretty sure that would be sooner than later. I never thought the camera on the garage behind our house and the one on our front porch would be in range. Not a problem at all. I have only set up those 2 cameras outside so far. After the initial usb charging I left the other 2 on my work bench with the solar panels attached. Amazingly the over head light at my work bench has kept them charged up. She loves feeding the outside cats that come to our backdoor. I was using a trail cam so she could watch but it meant moving it all the time and removing the sd card daily to see what is on it. With this system not only can my wife enjoy watching the cats (all of which she has named) but the occasional skunks and possums that show up and eat right along side the cats. It has been cheap entertainment for the boss. Catching potential porch pirates is an added bonus from my point of view. The set up was really simple. We still have a wireless camera bird feeder in the box that my daughter gave my wife 3 years ago. Periodically I get it out and try to do the setup and fail each time. No problem with this system! I'm going to set up one of the remaining cameras for bird watching. Our area is pretty rural . Anyone who lived in the country in our area would undoubtedly be able to watch all kinds of deer bear, coyotes etc. Durability is very important to me so if these stand the test of time I will edit this and give them a 5 across the board.

I am very happy with the support and the system. solar has been effective to charge. I am also very impressed with the app. the settings, UI, etc. are intuitive. 100% satisfied. Night vision could be better. But for its price, So far so good !!!!", "Very easy to set up to get it going and happy with the product. My house is on a 60\u2019 x 200\u2019 lot. I placed the cameras underneath the roof soffit about 10 feet off the ground at the four corners of my house and locate the home base unit next to the Wi-Fi router in my study room on the 2nd floor about the mid-point between all the cameras. All my cameras are located at least about 75-100 feet from the home base unit and they are all able to achieve no less than 4 out of 5 bars for the signal strength. The color live and recorded videos are very sharp and clear during the day and also at night, even when it is very dark and under poor lighting conditions. The cameras also have a feature to turn on the infra read lights automatically. However, the videos will become black and white but still remain crisp and sharp. The solar panels that come with the camera can provide sufficient charge to the cameras with just average 1-2 hours of strong sun light per day. If I disconnect the solar panel power cable from the camera, with a 100% battery charge the camera would still run for about 3-4 weeks with a few recording clips made every night before the power being depleted down to about \u00bc. The cameras also work well day and night even when the temperature sometimes dipped below -20C during the winter. I live in Canada.  The Aosu app provides many features and flexibility, including the motion detection set up. The cameras detect movements up to about 20-30 feet away, even at night and in the rain, when the detection sensitivity is set at maximum. I notice there is virtually little difference with the detection range between day and night. However, after detecting a movement, the cameras would take about a few seconds to start the recording so very often the recordings would not capture the first few moments of the movement.  I am very satisfied with the Aosu cameras and I bought 3 more extra Aosu 2K cameras for placing them on the fence adding on to the existing system with a total of 7 cameras and they are all being managed by the same the Aosu app on my cell phone with no problem. Unfortunately, since the home base unit can only accommodate the recordings of 4 cameras, the recording storage for the 2 additional cameras have to done through micro SD cards inside the cameras and the 3rd extra camera that I bought contains its internal memory storage so I didn\u2019t have to purchase any micro SD cards. I however notice not all the Aosu 2K cameras offer the same viewing angle width. The cameras that require micro SD cards do not capture the same width compare to the 4 cameras that comes with the home base package. Read more", "I recently purchased the AOSU 2K Security Cameras for my home, and I couldn't be more satisfied with the level of security and peace of mind they provide. The standout feature for me is the battery-operated design. No need for complex wiring or worrying about power outages. This camera works flawlessly on battery power, and it's incredibly convenient to install anywhere around my property. The PIR Human Motion Detection is incredibly accurate. It ensures that I receive alerts only when there's actual movement, reducing false alarms. The full-color night vision is a game-changer. It provides crystal-clear footage even in low light conditions, and the built-in spotlight adds an extra layer of security. The two-way audio feature allows me to communicate with visitors or potential intruders from anywhere, adding a personal touch to my home security. And in case of suspicious activity, the built-in siren can be activated, deterring potential threats. The installation was straightforward, and the mobile app is user-friendly. I can easily monitor my property remotely and receive instant alerts if something triggers the motion detection. In summary, the AOSU 2K Security Cameras have elevated my home security to a whole new level. They're reliable, packed with features, and offer the peace of mind I've been looking for. If you're in search of a top-notch outdoor security camera, these are a fantastic choice. I highly recommend them for their performance and ease of use.

La base ella necesita estar cerca de un cable rj45 de \"red local\" o cerca del router para conectar por cable.l abase consume muy poco y trae un peque\u00f1o adaptador de enchufe a 12v. La luz azul de la vase es demasiado intenso de noche para mi gusto si tienes el router en donde duermes quizas debas poner un adhesivo para ocultar la luz de led de puesta en marcha de la base. Cuando una camara detecta un presencia se escucha un ligero click clack en su interior algun rele supongo por eso consumen tan poco y dura tanto la bateria.Los soporte y los paneles solar son de buena calidad. La puesta en marcha inicial es super simple. El altavoz de la camara tiene una calidad regular como todas estas tipo de camaras creo. Puede elgir un zona en la iamgen de la camara donde quieres que se detecte el movimeinto, muy comod si no quieres que grabe a cada vez que pasa alguien por un camino. Tiene tambien zona de privacidad por si por ejemplo graba delante de tu casa y se ve las ventanas de \u00f1a casa del vecino puede (y debe) tapar esta zona por pricacidad es logico igual que grabar la via publica es sentido com\u00fan. Las camaras tiene definicion 2K o fluida la fluida es realmente lo bastante buena \u00f1ara cosas cercanas no hay diferencia. La 2K p seria solo si la carama esta muy alta por ejemplo, en modo fluido se supone avisa m\u00e1s rapido pero no note mucha diferencia mabos son rapidos. La detecion de movimiento (sin suscripcion de nube) es ajustable por ejemplo solo Humanos para que no pite los gatos, tbien se puede ajustar su sensibilidad un peque\u00f1o esquema explica bien cual debes elegi o bien autoajuste. La xamara graba siempre los enventos pero solo envia notificacion al movil cuando tu quieres puede elgir franjas horarias, con un modo inmediatoas rapido pero detecta pero la diferencia entre humano y gato, y modo inteligente mejor pero un poco m\u00e1s lento (ambos son rapidos no hay mucha diferencia). Piede elegir para cada camara si grabar el sonido o no. Si el panel solar no carga bien la camara recibiras un aviso. Puedes compartir el acceso para ver las camaras con otras personas, deben instalar la app crear un cuenta luego tu les invitas desde tu apo agregando su email y listo. Puede activar o no la luz led que indica la puesta en marcha de la camara. Compatible con alexa y google asist. En lo detaille puede acerder nuemero de serie de la camara ver la intesidad de se\u00f1al entre la base y la camara, borrar eventos locales, cambiar el nombre de la camara. En informe de la homa base puede ver cuanto memoria estas usando de la base cuantas camara hay comectada a esa base. Hay un apartado de actualizacion de firmware que te avisa si es necesario es super sim\u00f1le solo seguir lo que indica la app. Hay una opcion de inicio rapido que te indica como configurar todo eso y te gu\u00eda pero realmente no es tan complicado y la app es agradable no creo que a nadie se le complique eso. Hay un opcion la desvincular una camara en caso necesario. La base tiene supropio apartado donde puede cambiar wl nombre ver si ca\u00f1acidad de almacenamient. Hay un paragado de servico tecnico como un chat en la app atiende bien no responde super rapido pero es razonable y por loenos te responde que otros ni eso.

Le altre funzionalit\u00e0 sono la visione notturna con gli infrarossi e a colori grazie ai led bianchi che ha nella parte frontale, la rilevazione del movimento che vi avvisa con una notifica e con l\u2019anteprima di chi era davanti alla telecamera ogni volta che c\u2019\u00e8 movimento e la sirena (abbastanza) come vedete nel video che ho allegato, audio a due direzioni che si sente bene in entrambe le direzioni, cio\u00e8 potrete anche parlare con chi sta davanti alla telecamera, come se fosse un video citofono, ed \u00e8 impermeabile certificata IP66.  La telecamera \u00e8 2K quindi avrete una visione molto nitida di quello che succede nell\u2019area sorvegliata, invia una notifica all\u2019app del telefono (se la funzione \u00e8 abilitata) ogni volta che rileva un movimento davanti ad essa, con la scritta \u201cAosu rileva che c\u2019\u00e8 movimento davanti alla stanza di famiglia\u201d nel mio caso. E vedrete anche una foto di chi stava davanti alla telecamera in quel momento. Se cliccate sulla foto entrerete nella modalit\u00e0 anteprima che vi mostra il video realtime di quello che succede e potrete anche parlare con chi sta li, inviare messaggi preimpostati nell\u2019app come quello che sentite nel video e far scattare una sirena. Se invece si tratta di una persona conosciuta potrete semplicemente parlare con lei come se la telecamera fosse un normale video citofono.  \u00c8 anche possibile registrare il video come in una telecamera a circuito chiuso gratuitamente su microSD e su cloud in prova gratuita per 7 giorni.  La batteria da 5000 mAh \u00e8 data per una durata di 1-2 mesi, ma ovviamente dipende dall\u2019uso e dalle temperature di utilizzo. Durer\u00e0 un po\u2019 meno, nel mio casa \u00e8 durata 20 giorni circa, che \u00e8 una durata di tutto rispetto per un dispositivo di queste caratteristiche e per tutto quello che offre. La durata dipende in particolare da quanti rilevamenti di movimento, quante notifiche dovr\u00e0 inviare e da quante volte vi connetterete in modalit\u00e0 anteprima per la visione realtime sul telefono, che \u00e8 quella che consuma di pi\u00f9 ovviamente.  La connessione alla rete WiFi (solo da 2.4 GHz \u00e8 supportata) \u00e8 semplificata dalla connessione prima con bluetooth, e dalla procedura con QR code e messaggi vocali di risposta della stessa telecamera. Vedrete quanto \u00e8 semplice. \u00c8 possibile anche associarla ad Alexa e all\u2019Assistente di Google.  La telecamera fa anche un\u2019analisi intelligente del movimento e un tracking delle figura umane che compaiono nel video. L\u2019angolo di visione \u00e8 ottimo, direi 160-170 gradi.  L\u2019estetica \u00e8 molto bella e moderna con un bianco molto minimale e la parte frontale nero ludico che le da un aspetto tecnologico che rispecchia tutta la tecnologia che ha davvero all\u2019interno.  Nella confezione trovate la telecamera IP a batteria, il cavo di ricarica (il caricatore non \u00e8 incluso nella confezione, vi consiglio almeno un \u00eco da 1A, ma anche da 2A per una ricarica pi\u00f9 veloce), il materiale per il fissaggio al muro (non i cacciaviti), il manuale d\u2019uso anche in italiano e un adesivo che avvisa che l\u2019area \u00e8 videosorvegliata h24.  La telecamera e l\u2019app per il suo utilizzo anche da remoto mi sono molto piaciute perch\u00e9 molto curate sia nei materiali (la telecamera), che nelle funzioni, e nell\u2019accuratezza di sviluppo (l\u2019app), quindi la consiglio a tutti quelli che vogliono un po\u2019 di sicurezza davanti alla porta di casa o ovunque si voglia, ma anche come videocitofono, vista la semplicit\u00e0 con cui si pu\u00f2 installare, realmente senza fili.

And I found all of these things when I purchased this Mubview wireless doorbell camera. It was super easy to install and sinc up to my I-Phone. I placed it under my front door porch about 10\" away from my door handle as you can see in the attached photo. Due to it's fairly wide angle lens it's in a perfect location for me to see anyone that stands in front of my door and even when they're off to the side as well.  Customizing the settings to your preference is also easy peasy. I can set the motion detection sensitivity anywhere I want as it can be adjusted on a scale of 1-5. So even though I'm facing a street that's around 40' in front of my house, I can set the motion detection sensitivity up to level 4 to trigger when vehicles go by or I can set it lower to level 3 so vehicles aren't triggering the alarm.  Looking at alarms that came through in the middle of the night is simple by just going to my history on the cameras app where I can either manually scroll through the alarm times or the app will scroll forward through these alarm triggers for me. The night vision is in black and white but very clear and I'm happy with it.  One of my concerns was how long the battery would last, especially living in the north where it's cold. I've had the camera installed around 3 weeks now and my battery says it's at 50%. With the cold temps we've had, sometimes below zero for a few days and then back to the 30's and 40's I am super pleased, especially knowing that I've been taxing the battery more than I will normally by playing around with it and having fun.  The length of the videos taken is also customizable at 10, 20 or 30 seconds. I set mine to 20 seconds and wondered if that longer time would deplete my battery sooner, so it may but my battery is in great shape as described above so I'll be leaving it at 20 for now.  I look at reviews a lot to figure out what I'm going to buy and I don't leave reviews very often, though I should. In saying that I felt that folks should know that my experience with the Mubview camera has been excellent thus far and I'm really glad I made this purchase,. There's a lot more great features that I haven't addressed but then this review would go on forever. So I'm giving it two thumbs up to all of you who are looking for a decent reliable easy to use full featured doorbell camera. Ta Da! Read more", " I was looking for a few key features when I decided to get a doorbell cam: 1. Good person detection. I didn't want alerts due to shadows, cars. 2. Option to use local storage to save on cloud fees. 3. Good app with timely alerts so I don't miss folks at the door. 4. Good value... didn't want to buy a Ring  The AI person detection is very good. It hasn't missed a package being dropped off or someone coming up to the door as far as I can tell. This is a huge feature, as I had another wireless camera on the door, but it was picking up shadows, cars, and our flag waving about... even when setting a detection zone. So, this is 5 stars for motion detection. I have an Android phone and their app is pretty good. I get alerts in a timely fashion so I can see people coming up to the door, packages being dropped off, and I've answered someone at the door when I've been out of town. All of this works well. One thing, and I saw someone else mention this, you'll want to setup separate accounts to \"share\" the phone with others in the house. Sharing out your credentials will only allow one person to be \"logged into\" the camera at a time. Just setup a new account and share access with the new people and this works fine. I've had the unit for about a month so far and the battery is at 35% now. This is pretty good since I have the motion detection sensitivity set to high, and the recording time set to 30 seconds. So, the camera is recording quite a bit to the local SD card as well as streaming video back to me when I check on it. There are many options to setup the camera... cloud storage (I have not tried), limiting the recording interval, night vision (camera area is well lit at night, so I can't say how well this feature works), alerting schedules, etc. Installation is easy as I just used the double sided tape to mount it to my wall. Screws are included if you need those. You mount the holder and place the camera into it, then put in a screw at the bottom to secure the unit. If someone takes the camera out of the holder an alarm will go off (see my video) and you get an alert on the app. That's a cool feature. Setting up the accompanying doorbell alert inside the house was easy. Just put in the batteries and pair it with the unit. There are a few different ringtone like options. Overall, I'm very happy with the unit... will update this review if anything changes. Read more", "The quality of the images is incredible, and the response time is great! There are only a couple of issues: 1. if you mount it on your door (for renters), it will think every little breeze is \"someone is demolishing\" and it sends and annoying alarm that you can't turn off. 2. the door chime will not program no matter what. It's pointless. I just use the camera and phone to see who's ringing since my phone stays with me 24/7 (I can't always hear the bell outside my door). But if you're the type to put away your phone and your home is too big to hear the chime from the door, you may need to rethink this particular model. Otherwise, it works really well without the chime box.", "We went without a doorbell for a few years, I figured it was time to get a doorbell with the added features of a video unit. The initial setup was a simple app download to your smartphone, and the installation was simple. A few nice features; (1) camera is micro USB rechargeable so no batteries required, and the app displays the battery life (2) the \"door bell\" module is wireless and works with batteries or the supplied micro USB and it can be placed in a convenient place and can be moved close to wherever you are (3) app can be accessed while you are at or away from home, a great piece of mind. Video quality is better than expected, motion and app notifications can be adjusted, and the app is fairly intuitive and simple to use.", "Me encant\u00f3, mejor timbre, intercomunicador, gadget para armar tu casa inteligente, y camara de videovigilancia, tengo 2 d\u00edas con el y la verdad calidad precio ya que no necesitas una suscripci\u00f3n para guardar video ya que autom\u00e1ticamente se almacena por micro SD. Solo que el env\u00edo duro casi un mes, pero si vale la pena adquirilo", "I am not a fan of giving opinions about my purchases, but on this occasion I took the liberty of doing so for the following reasons: What I liked was the price, I say this because the product arrived incomplete. And what I liked was that I contacted Technical Service via email on December 4 of this year, in which I explained that Amazon.ca was not receiving this product as a refund. In a few minutes I received news from MUBVIEW. They apologized for the inconvenience and they only asked me for the serial number of the doorbell. The next day I received another email where they told me: We sent you a new doorbell. You will receive it around 9th, Dec. This solution was the fastest for me than I imagined. I would like to send you to everyone who works for WUBVIEW. My most sincere congratulations for the excellent work they do, the high quality of customer service and the speed with which they resolve cases. I will wait to receive the new product that I am 100% sure will arrive complete and that way I can use it with confidence. FOR THOSE WHO SEE THIS PRODUCT: MUBVIEW Wireless Doorbell Camera with Chime, WiFi Video Doorbell Camera with Voice Chager, Motion Detector, Anti-Theft Device, 2K HD, Night Vision, 2-Way Audio, Storage (Optional) I CAN RECOMMEND THEM TO THOSE WHO WANT A DORBELL OF HIGH EXCELLENCE", "The doorbell does need a 2.4 Ghz wifi network so make sure your router has a 2.4 Ghz network. Opening the live stream takes a few seconds, longer than I'd like but acceptable. The quality of video streamed from this doorbell through the Mubview app is great. Even night vision works well. The motion detection is good, it usually alerts me within a few seconds when motion is detected. On Android you need to grant the app all possible permissions. Just be aware that you will only get the app making a ringing noise and allowing you to answer and speak to the caller if your phone is locked. If the phone is unlocked, it notifies me of motion but doesn't ring. You get a very limited amount of cloud storage but motion detected events and when people ring the bell can be stored on a MicroSD card inserted into the doorbell. Recorded events usually show a few seconds of the person walking up to the doorbell, and a few seconds when they leave. Battery life seems to be somewhere around 2 months. It's a little awkward to charge and the device has a Micro USB port rather than type-C which would be far preferrable. I find that to charge it, I tape a USB battery pack to the door and run a cable through the letterbox. This is fine since it will only have to be done every few months or so. Battery life is obviously much better if you're not constantly viewing the live stream and checking events.", "I have tried many digital door bells and found this to be only door bell to exceed my expectations. Is easy to install, allows you to store history in SD card, adjust sensitivity level of motion sensor and volume level of the two way audio fuctions. I have been using it for a week and I'm happy with the product thus far.", "Best product on the market for this price range.

I decided to buy a memory card, so that I can also use it for security. The motion detection works very well. It takes a short video and sends an alert to my phone whenever it is triggered.  The manual shows how to setup and install the camera. It does not show how to use any of the features, so you have to figure that out for yourself. It is fairly obvious, but be sure to check out the settings menu. Installation is quick and easy. Since I have other TreatLife products connected to Alexa, the PP10 connected automatically by simply setting it up in the TreatLife app. I can now view the camera from my Echo Show. The diagram in the manual incorrectly showed the location of the memory card slot. A quick chat with their support team resolved the issue and they provided a corrected diagram. I was very pleased with their support.

I think its a great value.", "MUBVIEW Baby Monitor with Camera and Audio. Let's start the review with an overall design. I love the look and the feel of it. Little elegant looking camera that looks like a furniture accent, blends well with the interior. Good quality device.Comes with instructions, a mounting bracket and screws, and a USB/AC plug.  One could stand it on a surface or screw to the ceiling upside down (in the settings you would need to flip the screen). The electrical cable is relatively somewhat short, but since it's a USB, you could potentially get an extension USB cable (not included). This camera must be plugged in at all times to function.  The quality of the still images is superb, even in night mode, and the live feed is very good. You can select between qualities of the pictures, but keep in mind it will consume your SD card faster at HD images. The two way audio is good quality, you need to press a mike button on your phone, to speak, but the camera speaker is always on. There is a bit of a lag in audio/video, but that is normal from my experience. You could make screenshots and instantly share them, which is very convenient. You can zoom with your fingers off the screen. Remotely controlling the camera is easy, and effective, it rotates almost full circle, and has a good range top to bottom. If installed right, the camera can overlook the entire room on its own. Great peripheral field of view. Also of note the night mode takes pictures and has a live feed in black and white, versus daytime is in colour.  I couldn't find the sd card slot initially, its hidden behind the lens, you would have to roll the lens all the way up (see the pictures). Unfortunately The sd card is not included, so i could not test it with it, i would have to buy one later. The installation is fairly straightforward, you download the app, and follow the instruction wizard, register, connect and you are good to go. Plenty of languages for your interface to chose from (see pics).  Motion detection works well (i turned it off because every time the dog walks by it sends you a message, which is good if you need this working well). Easy access from the app to the live feed, no authentication needed, which on certain products is quite annoying.  The recording and data storage available in 2 options: SD card, or cloud storage. The amazon product description ad mentions a free 7 day loop recording storage cloud, but all i could find is an offer for a subscription, I will be calling the customer service to verify this information, because it is a little confusing (see pictures).  Overall we are very satisfied with the product, its priced fair, and performs well. 5/5 Read more", "Wir haben uns f\u00fcr zwei dieser Kameras entschieden, um unseren Hund in unserer Abwesenheit beobachten zu k\u00f6nnen.

It was pretty easy to set up when you follow the instructions and the video quality is also good (both day time and night vision). The one thing that I would note (and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that is does not come with an SD card which you need for storage. If you don't use an SD card, you'll have to sign up for cloud storage which has a subscription cost. Other than that, I'd say that the camera is at a fair price point for the quality you get!"], "Image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51iulXL8F-L.__AC_SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "Link": "https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo0NTExNTc4NDcwNTcwMDI0OjE3MDYxNzA1ODU6c3BfZGV0YWlsMjoyMDAxMjE4ODQ1OTQ4OTg6Ojo6&url=%2Fdp%2FB0BC9CC5RB%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_1%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB0BC9CC5RB%26pd_rd_w%3Dm31RQ%26content-id%3Damzn1.sym.0d1092dc-81bb-493f-8769-d5c802257e94%26pf_rd_p%3D0d1092dc-81bb-493f-8769-d5c802257e94%26pf_rd_r%3DQ415DAXANN6HWVGKHTM8%26pd_rd_wg%3DaR2MR%26pd_rd_r%3D89038203-a5c8-4f3c-81b2-cd29d2eac110%26s%3Dphoto%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWwy"}, {"Name": "Mo Digital Cameras for Photography & 4K Video, 48 MP Vlogging Camera for YouTube with 180\u00b0 Flip Screen,16X Digital Zoom,Flash & Autofocus,52mm Wide Angle & Macro Lens,2 Batteries,32GB SD Card", "Price": "149.98", "Details": ["\ud83c\udfa5\u301048MP Digital Camera for Photoggraph\u3011The digital camera features 48MP photo resolution and detachable lens, which is very suitable for close-up shooting of large scenes and small objects.With our 52mm wide-angle lens,this compact camera can expand the angle of view to 120 degrees to provide a wider range of views.

Night vision is good and with the spotlight, it is in color. They can be mounted with the lens up or down orientation as the picture can be flipped 180 degrees.

I sent my email at 4pm and had a response the next day at 6am (14 hour response). Their suggestions were helpful and were courteous. I didn't respond back to them and 2 days later I had a follow up email from them. Best customer service I've personally had in many years both in person, on the phone and the internet. They asked me to contact them anytime with further questions and I will. I'm very happy with the cameras, only surpassed by their support team. I would definitely recommend the cameras and seller. I've now had several more chances to contact them due to one of the cameras going offline after about 7 days.

I love the solar panels, so my wife and I don't have to worry about replacing batteries for putting me cameras outside and having to run a power cord through the window. The solar panels are pretty small and we have them on the edge of the roof.  We have one outside in the front pointed at our cars and the street, and another one in the backyard pointing mainly at our shed.  Much better video than the old 720p cameras we had before. It has two-way sound, alert sound, a small floodlight that you can choose to go off every time motion is detected, and a text every time motion is detected. It's a great buy. I believe it is the best buy if you want solar panel outdoor video cameras with great features and good video and a great price!", "Great video/picture. Very clear and covers a large area.

The installation was pretty much a breeze, just might depend from case to case how and where you install your cameras. I opted for a solar panel to charge my cameras, and they work very well! The quality is good and the features all work as advertised! The wireless setup process was pretty smooth. I\u2019d say motion detection works 90% of the time, i think it depends how you position your camera bc the instructions does state that tracking side to side works better than something approaching the camera head on. The app itself is also pretty good, pretty user friendly and easy to setup.

I record with regular indoor lighting and this camera was able to record clear video at all the available resolutions, although I typically record at 1080p 30 fps to get best results without using a ton of memory space.  The menu is easy to navigate and even though the manual does not go much into depth for describing all the menu functions, I was able to search the web and watch YouTube videos to get a better understanding of the various menu functions. For the most part, I have been using the default menu settings except for Recording Resolution, which I set for 1080P 30fps and metering mode, which I set to Matrix Metering.  The internal microphone is adequate for recording voice audio from within a few feet from the camera, but it was not what I wanted for recording music. I initially had an issue with using external microphones. I contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in responding to my inquiries and helping me resolve my issue with using external microphones. I wanted to record from two speakers that were connected to my E-Drum Kit and connecting the microphones direct to the camera using a stereo Y splitter would not work, also I could not get regular external camera microphones to work either. However, the seller gave me the information I needed to get the right equipment to record the way I wanted to record.  The camera records audio in Mono (one channel) using a 3.5mm (1/8\u201d) TRS mic jack. The camera\u2019s mic input also needed to come from a powered mic source and the mic output must be in Mono. There are many battery powered mics to be found on Amazon. I decided to get a Comica CVM-AX1 mic mixer that can take a Stereo input from two mics and output to the camera in Mono. For my shotgun mic I got a Comica V30 PRO. Both of these mic solutions work great with this camera and each of these two items cost less than $50 each.  I also upgraded the memory card to a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card for around $15  All-in-all, even with these additional items I purchased, it cost a lot less than the $500~$600 price of a brand name camera.

The app integration is nice and has no lag when connecting through the internet and putting the camera to sleep for privacy is simple as pressing one button.

It has two way audio, so I can hear what is being said on the other side very well. (The folks cannot hear me quite as well when I talk from my end, but I can get basic ideas across.) You can turn the cam 360 degrees horizontaly and you can look up and down vertically. I need to monitor a room remotely, so this cam lets me do that very well.

I appreciated the fast support and urgency to make sure I felt my needs were met.", "Some of the cameras were defective, but the company promptly replaced them. Moreover, I\u2019ve tried many brands of cameras, but after getting the Aosu doorbell camera, I liked it so much I got one for my family. After that I got half a dozen of Aosu pan and tilt indoor. There were things in the user interface that I didn\u2019t like and the company responded to the feedback within one update. Everything I mentioned was added! I\u2019ve never met a company that actually implemented individual feedback. Usually the company collects a bunch of feedback and if enough people ask for the same thing, then they implement it eventually.  Aosu cameras have great quality. They have something other UI don\u2019t have, which is an indication of events on the playback track itself. You can jump to an event which is coloured in blue, or you can start recording before the event (but if you want to record the event with before and after make sure you start recording slightly before the event in blue otherwise it will record the event and say \u201cfile saved\u201d). The audio is great, however I don\u2019t ever use the family call button. I use the cameras on 5 GHz internet but the good thing is you can use both! Other cameras only use 2.4. The main reason I selected Aosu is the value = pan and tilt + 2K quality. Very good price for the features you get and the user interface is quite pleasant.  The customer service is always on the ball. You can message them through Amazon or through Aosu app and they always reply and resolve. I love that. No wonder I got half a dozen cameras from them!

Wyze used to be good however they have become increasingly greedy taking away things that they promised were for a lifetime. I decided to try a different brand and these AOSU cameras have been awesome. The app is very straightforward and easy to use and you can view your SD recorded moments at any time. Once in a blue moon the app tends to crash or I should say the camera feed crashes and doesn't connect and I have to force close the app and restart otherwise they have been rock solid without any issues regarding camera functionality.  I will definitely be replacing all my Wyze cameras with this brand going forward. My next purchase will be their outdoor solar panel motion capture cameras. No point having multiple cameras with multiple apps, I will stick with one brand and one app and definitely AOSU will be the one.

The install is easier on this model only requiring two screws with wall anchors (if needed) to install. The screws could be a little longer, but they are adequate. The mounting plate is fixed to the camera body unlike previous models in which it separates for installation. The video quality and night vision are very good without being super high res taking up too much of the memory. The free cloud storage only gives you 6 second snippets and only holds it for 30 days (I think?) but it's enough to download if you have an event (break-in or package theft or whatever). And the cloud service is reasonably priced if you end up wanting more cloud storage. It takes up to 128 Micro SD card for local storage. It very quickly and easily connects to my wifi. The app seems a little clunky at first, but once you get explore it a bit it is pretty easy to navigate. I do wish it could go a bit wider on the view, but it is pretty decent as evidenced in the attached photo where you can see the coverage is about a full 90 degree shot of the front of my house from front to carport on side. Quickly notifies if the motion detection is on. It has options for alarms and strobe lights if desired. The solar panel with only afternoon/evening light adequately charges the camera.

I purchased 3 cameras and I would definitely recommend but there are a few things I wish would improve. The cameras are very clear in the day and at night. They pick up any type of motion and I love the pan, tilt, zoom. BUT, I wish the pan, tilt, zoom would move automatically on its own rather than me having to do it in the app. These cameras are not totally wireless because you have to use the solar panel which has a wire to it and it makes the camera look ugly. I had to hide the wires somehow from the solar panel. It is great to have to not use batteries and change them out vs. having the solar panel which does hold a great charge. But I wish the camera had a solar feature inside it or on top of it. The customer service people are very prompt by email. I bought 3 SD cards for these cameras so I can go back and view the history on the videos. These cameras should definitely come with these SD cards. There is no subscription, set up was easy, and I have great WI-FI through direct TV. Cameras do not buffer, they come on pretty quickly when I access the app. At night, when I pull in the driveway, the light on the camera comes on, which I like. It is super sensitive and picks up any motion. People walking, dogs running, trucks or cars coming down the street. Oh and I also think that there should be a little booklet with the icon definitions that explain what certain icons means. I emailed them asking them and they were knowledgeable about the icons. Overall, these cameras are great for a great price. But the wires from the solar panel get on my nerves!!!! I wonder if I can disconnect the panel and only use them when the cameras need charging???

In addition, if you already have another are you geek camera installed with the app on your phone, this new camera is incredibly easy to install and configure .  And did I mention the price?

It is too early to talk about solar panels performance, so I leave that to the next review I am going to make, so this time my review is about security cameras and software. Now I have cameras from all 4 sides of my house, and I think that gives me good protection from intruders. I confirm the security cameras are solidly constructed, reliable and the software works well. The battery capacity seems good. The cameras are easy to install, the image quality is very good and cameras react pretty good for any movements.

It has good weight without being heavy, feels solid and operates smoothly. I've only had it a very short while, so I can't speak to longevity issues yet, but I am initially optimistic, This camera has three levels of video quality transmission and has maintained signal integrity better than most other cameras I've tried. I have it set on my 2.4 Ghz band and it can send/receive reliably 100 feet and several walls away from my router. Unlike many other off-brands sold here, Reolink encrypts their cameras, so you are not open to anyone in the world to easily sneak peek or hack. As others have stated in their reviews, setup can be tricky if you don't follow the instructions to the letter. I would suggest setting up a Reolink account (in addition to downloading their app) BEFORE attempting any setup. It will make the process easier. Please understand that this Reolink does not play well with some VPN's. If you frequently use a VPN, you may find that you'll have to pause it to complete the camera installation and/or view it live in the Reolink app. During the installation process, you should set your phone to the same band/network you want your camera on. I like the 2.4 Ghz band for its extra range. I believe this camera uses the 80211-n protocol and if you have an 80211-ac or ax router, it might slow down your router if you choose to use use the 5Ghz band. Unlike some reviewers stated here, my setup does fine on the 2.4 Ghz band and I can assure you that you DON'T have to be on the same network to view the camera once installation is completed. The app itself can be difficult to navigate at times with a few submenus. App controls use a virtual D-pad to PTZ and it is not as fast as other app's swipe controls. Inexplicably, the microSD slot and pinhole reset button are not accessible unless the camera is pointing as far up as it will go. If you have trouble setting this camera up, the reset button will be hidden out of sight (and the instructions may tell you to reset the camera WITHOUT clearly telling you where the reset is). On a related matter, there is a pinhole right below the lens and status light. That is the un-labled microphone hole. If you mistake that pinhole for the reset pinhole much further down on the the ball, you may mistakenly push the reset tool into your microphone, thereby damaging your camera's mike. Please don't ask how I found that particular fact out...

Very nice system, and easy on the wallet", "Adventures in setting up was a mess, but while I am still learning stuff, the picture is excellent. But the tiny booklet is worthless in how to set up, although the website has lots of info but has to look at scads of articles.  I have used Dropcam for many years, which can access via Internet site. I have a Gigiblast fast Internet service. I rarely use a smartphone other than for mapping when traveling; I can not type on those tiny keys. I have six 28\" monitors in front of me at my home office, and when I travel, I pack a full Logitech keyboard with a laptop. I use the camera for my large home office security, especially when traveling.  I spent days researching and reading reviews wanting when traveling to view from a PC or Laptop. So decided on this Reolink E1 Zoom, and then the excitement (confusion) to set up began,  The quick start guide started me on a many-hour journey to figure out.  First, it says to mount the camera. Ah... isn't that like getting the cart before the horse or whatever that expression is. No, let me coddle the little guy on my desk, so I can do whatever has to be done without trying to work on it mounted (which will be on a cabinet top)  Starting with downloading and launching App OR Client software. I am a nerd and read that it is either, not both. So I got the client, and, of course, I was totally lost. So I went to the app store on my PC, and it indicated it was not available on \"other\" devices. OK, I dug out my smartphone and found I am still trying to figure out why I already had the app. But I couldn't find the cute little guy (aka camera). Well, you have to plug it in!  I had read/scanned all the reviews and remembered something about not using the little thing on the bottom to plug in since it was the tiny mic, so I could destroy it if you thought that was where you plug in power. But OK, the picture shows it's a power port. So plug it in, and some women started screaming at me in many languages; that startled me, and I didn't catch what the English said. OK, something works.  Unless I am blind, nothing in the little guide says anything about the Ethernet connection. Now I go back to OS/2 days before the Windows GUI (dos screen) and back to old card readers - you know, IBM punch cards - yes, I am old.  I have a MAZE router system. All the Ethernet ports are full, as are my six ports on a switch. I have MOCA for TIVO, two for NAS, and a printer, and I don't know what else since it's a mess and set up years ago and just works.  OK, pull one of the NAS connections and find a spare cable - hopefully, the yellow one works, or is that a \"patch\" cable... well let's try it vs. some 30-foot ones! This part goes smoothly, besides turning the big Orbi router upside down and getting my magnifier to read the tiny printed password. OK, set up pw for the camera, etc.; that part is fine.  The rest of the setup went fine, and we got a great video on the client both in the light and at night. Beware; however, if you are in the same room and testing, the audio may get scratching feedback or constant echoes.  Now the microSDXC SanDisk 256k. The first challenge is the human-proof security packaging. I made multiple attempts with a knife, scissors, and willpower just to tear open the plastic security wrapping just to get it and the readout of the package.  I recalled from the research you have to point the guy all the way up to get to the tiny port. OK, little guy, open WIDE... barely clears the tiny opening. After a few failed attempts and finding a video watching at a slow speed to be sure I was putting it in the right with almost no clearance when it closed its mouth, I think it is in! I hope I never have to get it out!  Now the guy tells me that it has to be formatted. Look all over the client app setting until you give up and find instructions and videos on the website. I must dig out my smartphone again since I have to use the app. Once found from all the zillions of articles in the support part of the web, the video and directions gave good directions. This is after I searched the client's 66-page online manual and found nothing on how to format the disk.  I still must learn some options and settings, but it now seems excellent. It would have saved many hours of frustration for us that are not camera geek's if some of this was in a well-organized, one-place how set of instructions.  Hopefully, this review might help others as inexperienced with the camera setup as I was.

However my son lives in Virginia and his has remained at 100% for the past 9mo without any problem.  Easy to set up and install.

It picks up my internet router antenna much better than the other cameras. Connection is faultless, which is huge for me. I'm trying to be realistic with solar cameras in this price range. NONE of them are very good, and these are the best I've found. Other than dawn, at least one of the 2 cameras will catch the motion almost all the time.  I have Reolink wired cameras that record 24/7. They're excellent. But if we lose electricity for an extended period of time, they don't work. These backup cameras are for that scenario.

Here's how I had to connect: the product manual tells you to install the app, click the plus (+) sign in the top right, and the add the base station by scanning the QR code on its bottom. This is where my experience forked: it will then tell you to hit the sync buttons to connect the cameras - FIRST, USE THE PLUS SIGN TO ADD THE CAMERA IN THE APP (scan QR codes on the bottom of the cameras, like the base), THEN CONNECT VIA SYNC. I hope this saves someone else the headache. Reading the other reviews, I may be the only person with this issue.  I tried over and over with the steps listed in the manual and on the app, and sometimes the audio would even tell me they paired successfully, but I couldn't find them in the app. (I like that it gives you audio feedback, by the way). Well, after finally figuring out how they connect, I'm really happy with them.  The picture quality is great, but, it will wash out if you have a bright spot of sunlight. My property has trees, so often shaded areas appear clearly, while sunny areas are washed out. This is typical of most camera systems, though it would be nice if it could negate this with some HDR tech.  The included mounting hardware is fantastic! I like its mount, and I like that I can screw it in. I'm coming from Arlo where the magnetic mount is the only sensible way to go. I feel better having it more permanently affixed.  The one flaw that bugs me is the big power/sync button on the unit itself. I don't like that someone who could potentially reach one of the units could just turn it off or desync it. I would like this a lot better if it had a software lock in the app to turn off the camera's button functionality.  I like that the cameras are large. Conspicuous security is sometimes a deterrent in itself.  Again, coming from Arlo, I like that there's no monthly service charge, and I can keep my recordings on SD card instead of pay for a cloud service.  All in all, this is a big step up from my old Arlo system. The video quality is high, it's simple to use (excepting the preliminary sync), and there's no ongoing fees.

It's like having a watchful eye that never sleeps!", "I purchased a security camera before, but it requires wire, some switch box, etc. Very complex to set up. But this set is pretty 'complete' -- all you need to a wifi router at home and plug in the base. The instruction coming with the box is not that detailed, but there's a QR code to scan and get a very detailed instruction online. Pretty easy to connect the camera to the base, though I tried a couple of times -- the key is just to patiently wait, and listen to the voice notification from the devices, instead of just clicking next step on your phone. After connected, you just need a simple drilling and install the camera to where you want -- that's all! There's something a little bit annoying, that is I installed it near my front door, and whenever I go out or in, I'll receive video slips on my phone. Not sure whether there's a way to turn off the notification/not saving the videos, and just turn on when nobody at home. Another good thing is that it has a light with motion sensor. So it can be both a camera and a lighting device!", "I bought 2 of these kits, and it's true that they have good resolution and are easy to configure, but for some reason, in both, after one or two days, the cameras get disconnected and do not appear online. First one disconnects and then reappears, until it never comes back, and eventually, all 4 cameras drop out and I have to reconfigure them again.

One of the standout features of this camera is its super lightweight design, making it incredibly easy to carry around. This is perfect for on-the-go photography and vlogging.

Its lightweight build and the included accessories make it a great option for beginners or those on a tight budget.

I record with regular indoor lighting and this camera was able to record clear video at all the available resolutions, although I typically record at 1080p 30 fps to get best results without using a ton of memory space.  The menu is easy to navigate and even though the manual does not go much into depth for describing all the menu functions, I was able to search the web and watch YouTube videos to get a better understanding of the various menu functions. For the most part, I have been using the default menu settings except for Recording Resolution, which I set for 1080P 30fps and metering mode, which I set to Matrix Metering.  The internal microphone is adequate for recording voice audio from within a few feet from the camera, but it was not what I wanted for recording music. I initially had an issue with using external microphones. I contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in responding to my inquiries and helping me resolve my issue with using external microphones. I wanted to record from two speakers that were connected to my E-Drum Kit and connecting the microphones direct to the camera using a stereo Y splitter would not work, also I could not get regular external camera microphones to work either. However, the seller gave me the information I needed to get the right equipment to record the way I wanted to record.  The camera records audio in Mono (one channel) using a 3.5mm (1/8\u201d) TRS mic jack. The camera\u2019s mic input also needed to come from a powered mic source and the mic output must be in Mono. There are many battery powered mics to be found on Amazon. I decided to get a Comica CVM-AX1 mic mixer that can take a Stereo input from two mics and output to the camera in Mono. For my shotgun mic I got a Comica V30 PRO. Both of these mic solutions work great with this camera and each of these two items cost less than $50 each.  I also upgraded the memory card to a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card for around $15  All-in-all, even with these additional items I purchased, it cost a lot less than the $500~$600 price of a brand name camera.

The picture quality is slightly better than my iPhone (which takes good pictures) and the video quality is great. I really appreciate the wide lens provided and the Manual focus option which works better for me than auto-focus. It seems well constructed and I really like that it comes with a second battery. Definitely a good camera for beginners. The only issue I have is with the audio when recording videos. It\u2019s muffled. I am going to purchase a shotgun mic which as stated in other reviews, easily resolved that issue. Other than that, I love this camera. I would purchase again or recommend it to anyone that wants to take good quality videos and pictures for under $150.", "I recently purchased the \"Digital Cameras for Photography, 4K 48MP Vlogging Camera\" and wanted to share my thoughts on it. First off, I was pleasantly surprised by the packaging \u2013 it was sturdy and well-designed, which is always a good start.  One of the standout features of this camera is its super lightweight design, making it incredibly easy to carry around. This is perfect for on-the-go photography and vlogging. However, I ultimately decided to return it, not because of any flaws in the camera itself, but because I wanted a more high-end camera for my specific needs.  That being said, I must admit that this camera offers a lot of great features for its $100 price point. The 4K resolution and 48MP capability provide excellent image quality, and the 16X digital zoom allows for versatile framing options. I appreciated the inclusion of a 32GB Micro SD card and two batteries, which added to the overall value.  Additionally, the camera comes with a 52mm wide-angle lens and a macro lens, offering versatility for different types of photography. The manual focus option is a nice touch for those who prefer more control over their shots.  In summary, if you're a student or someone looking for a compact and budget-friendly camera with a good set of features, this camera is certainly worth considering. Its lightweight build and the included accessories make it a great option for beginners or those on a tight budget. However, if you're looking for top-tier performance, you may want to explore higher-end models.

I record with regular indoor lighting and this camera was able to record clear video at all the available resolutions, although I typically record at 1080p 30 fps to get best results without using a ton of memory space.  The menu is easy to navigate and even though the manual does not go much into depth for describing all the menu functions, I was able to search the web and watch YouTube videos to get a better understanding of the various menu functions. For the most part, I have been using the default menu settings except for Recording Resolution, which I set for 1080P 30fps and metering mode, which I set to Matrix Metering.  The internal microphone is adequate for recording voice audio from within a few feet from the camera, but it was not what I wanted for recording music. I initially had an issue with using external microphones. I contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in responding to my inquiries and helping me resolve my issue with using external microphones. I wanted to record from two speakers that were connected to my E-Drum Kit and connecting the microphones direct to the camera using a stereo Y splitter would not work, also I could not get regular external camera microphones to work either. However, the seller gave me the information I needed to get the right equipment to record the way I wanted to record.  The camera records audio in Mono (one channel) using a 3.5mm (1/8\u201d) TRS mic jack. The camera\u2019s mic input also needed to come from a powered mic source and the mic output must be in Mono. There are many battery powered mics to be found on Amazon. I decided to get a Comica CVM-AX1 mic mixer that can take a Stereo input from two mics and output to the camera in Mono. For my shotgun mic I got a Comica V30 PRO. Both of these mic solutions work great with this camera and each of these two items cost less than $50 each.  I also upgraded the memory card to a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card for around $15  All-in-all, even with these additional items I purchased, it cost a lot less than the $500~$600 price of a brand name camera.  I am happy with this purchase of the Wikico Camera. Read more", "This is exactly what I needed to take better pics of my crafts.

So far the picture quality is very nice, sharp and crisp resolution. There is a 5k resolution but it's not 16 by 9 it is square in 4 by 3 and only at 15 FPS so that is something to consider.

One of the standout features of this camera is its super lightweight design, making it incredibly easy to carry around. This is perfect for on-the-go photography and vlogging.

The 4K resolution and 48MP capability provide excellent image quality, and the 16X digital zoom allows for versatile framing options.

Additionally, the camera comes with a 52mm wide-angle lens and a macro lens, offering versatility for different types of photography. The manual focus option is a nice touch for those who prefer more control over their shots.

Its lightweight build and the included accessories make it a great option for beginners or those on a tight budget. However, if you're looking for top-tier performance, you may want to explore higher-end models. Read more", "I bought this camera to record my drum practice sessions and I needed to buy at a budget price. This camera met my needs to perform this function.  I record with regular indoor lighting and this camera was able to record clear video at all the available resolutions, although I typically record at 1080p 30 fps to get best results without using a ton of memory space.  The menu is easy to navigate and even though the manual does not go much into depth for describing all the menu functions, I was able to search the web and watch YouTube videos to get a better understanding of the various menu functions. For the most part, I have been using the default menu settings except for Recording Resolution, which I set for 1080P 30fps and metering mode, which I set to Matrix Metering.  The internal microphone is adequate for recording voice audio from within a few feet from the camera, but it was not what I wanted for recording music. I initially had an issue with using external microphones. I contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in responding to my inquiries and helping me resolve my issue with using external microphones. I wanted to record from two speakers that were connected to my E-Drum Kit and connecting the microphones direct to the camera using a stereo Y splitter would not work, also I could not get regular external camera microphones to work either. However, the seller gave me the information I needed to get the right equipment to record the way I wanted to record.  The camera records audio in Mono (one channel) using a 3.5mm (1/8\u201d) TRS mic jack. The camera\u2019s mic input also needed to come from a powered mic source and the mic output must be in Mono. There are many battery powered mics to be found on Amazon. I decided to get a Comica CVM-AX1 mic mixer that can take a Stereo input from two mics and output to the camera in Mono. For my shotgun mic I got a Comica V30 PRO. Both of these mic solutions work great with this camera and each of these two items cost less than $50 each.  I also upgraded the memory card to a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card for around $15  All-in-all, even with these additional items I purchased, it cost a lot less than the $500~$600 price of a brand name camera.

I have attempted to use indoor cameras in areas where the wifi signal was relatively poor - too poor to run the cameras. Consequently I had to use trail cameras in these areas and go in to manually check the SD cards on a daily basis. I have since installed three EZVIZ C8C cameras in these areas. The antennas receive the wifi signal good enough to use full function of the cameras and allow me to check activity from anywhere I am.", "I own many EzViz cameras(13) and for some reason they cannot design an outdoor WiFi camera that has any sort of range. Their tiny indoor WiFi cameras, of which I own 6, all have much better range and connection stability. I have one of those in my shed window(inside), probably 80 feet from my house, and it's works great. Over the last few years I've bought multiple iterations of their outdoor cameras starting with the \"Husky\" then to the newer version of the Husky and now these pan/tilt cameras. These are an all new design with external antennas, so I had had high hopes that they had improved the WiFi, but no, these are as bad and maybe worse than all their previous outdoor WiFi cams. A little background; I have the latest Google Nest mesh router system in my house, there is literally coverage everywhere, and 800Mbps internet. When I take my dog for a walk my phone stays connected to my WiFi for 150' down the street. All 3 of these new cams are mounted to the side of my house, and all of them are no more than 15' from one of the mesh router nodes. Two of them only have to transmit through one exterior wall, the other transmits through one exterior and one interior wall. Overall I'd say these connect with the app less than 50% of the time, sometimes an entire day will go by and they won't connect. And when they do connect and you get a picture it's usually unstable and pixilated, and then just drops out completely. Once again, this isn't an isolated incident, I bought THREE of these and they're all the same amount of sh!tty, just like their outdoor camera predecessors.

A couple issues I have though, which I can deal with or remedy. Mine is mounted on the corner of house and the downspout is directly in front of it. If I have it facing that direction at night with NV IR light on it lights up the downspout so bright that it washes out everything behind it. I had to get black felt and lay it along the downspout so it didn't have the reflection.  Other issue is the mic. Even a small breeze sounds like loud static interference. Like it does when you blow into a microphone. So if it were windy and you were trying to listen to what people are saying you wouldn't be able to hear them over the wind noise. I'll try and find the mic location to see if I can tape foam over it or something...  Other than those 2 issues it's a amazing.

The image quality is off the charts - the 48MP resolution means my pics are super sharp and detailed, and the 4K video is seriously next level. The fact that it comes with two batteries is a total lifesaver, especially on long shoots or when I'm out and about all day. And the 32GB SD card gives me plenty of storage space for all my snaps. The 16x digital zoom is also great, allowing me to get up close and personal with distant subjects without losing any detail.

Actually, I love the functionality of all the Kasa products I own which involves their smart lights, smart LED strip, smart surge protector, smart cameras, and more. I always recommend Kasa to those who ask me about smart home devices.", "I bought this to compare with EZVIZ C1C . Now these are not apples to apples because EZVIZ C1C camera is in 1080 HD and is not available in ]in 2K yet but they are close.  Picture Quality This is 2K , C1C is 1080. The variance in picture quality is noticeable but not enough that I\u2019d choose to pay significantly more for a product with 2K. Fortunately since it\u2019s holidays both are marked down to an extremely affordable price and so it's not a bad idea to take advantage of the better picture quality.3 .  Aesthetic Hands down EZVIZ looks better. The base and stand connecting piece is metal on EZVIZ whereas on Kasa/ T-P it\u2019s a cheap plastic . This also affects the movement. You get more motion on the EZVIZ which means better viewing/positioning. For some odd reason Kasa/T-P has a gray cord \u2026 for absolutely no reason - the unit is white and black , huge turn off for those who want a seamless transition to hide cords. The gray for some reason even makes the cord look bigger than the EZVIZ but I put them side by side and to my disbelief they are about the same width. I also have gray walls in my main room but this gray cord on a white and black product just looks odd and makes the cord stand out.  Sound Both record sound well. Mics are in the front so remember to take off plastic cover of lens or your mic won\u2019t record incoming sound (I made this mistake initially). Outbound sound (you talking from your phone through the camera) is from a speaker in back on both.  Wall Mount EZVIZ mount is better. EZVIZ camera can mount to things that attract magnets like the refrigerator by just putting it against the refrigerator. If mounting to the wall, EZVIZ can stick and mount. It comes with a 3M type sticker for attaching wall mount to wall and then the magnetic metal base of camera attaches to the wall. You can literally put this up in the EZVIZ up in less than 5 minutes. The EZVIZ has the option to mount the wall mount with a screw as well for a stronger mount . Kasa has screw only option. Going back to aesthetics a little. If wall mounting downward from ceiling, the Kasa looks better because it has a shorter stem/neck that connects to the base making it closer to the ceiling and not oddly sticking out of the ceiling. If mounting vertically on a wall, the EZVIZ looks better . If sitting on table both easily sit but the square look of the Kasa/TP just looks odd and stands out in an unattractive way. However both are incredibly small so you can disguise them or remove attention from them by putting other things on your table.  Extra Features Kasa has the detection of people. While some EZVIZ cameras have this feature, the one I\u2019m comparing that is closest to this product from EZVIZ does not. The starlight feature isn\u2019t great on the Kasa but it does work. I expected it to work when it\u2019s dark and was disappointed, to see in the complete dark it functions like any other infrared camera. However when there is dim lighting, the Starlight feature does show the video in color . I had it side by side on my mantle next to the EZVIZ camera and as it approached evening and I only had one lamp in the room on. There was a noticeable difference. With that said, the Starlight Feature works. I could see my daughter in color on the Kasa but not on the EZVIZ. When it\u2019s completely dark, there\u2019s no difference between the two camera\u2019s display. Both have the option for zone targeted recording but I don\u2019t think this feature works well in either camera from my testing.  Connection: Both connect fairly easily if you are used to electronics and general technology of recent years. For someone not keen on technology, the EZVIZ connects easier and is recommended for seniors in my opinion. They simply scan a QR code with EZVIZ , it picks up their Wi-Fi signal automatically and they are all set! Not so simple with Kasa. For Kasa it prompted me to go change my phones Wi-Fi to join their network before it could pick up the network in my house and then allowed the connection the connection to begin. These extra steps might be frustrating for an older person if they don\u2019t have help setting it up.  Apps The Kasa app seems like it\u2019s a better view if you are comfortable with technology. It looks like the integration of smart home might be easier. I can\u2019t say for sure that it\u2019s easier because I don\u2019t have smart plugs and smart lights but the look of the app presents it in a more appealing way than the EZVIZ. However , the basic simplicity of the EZVIZ may be better for someone not as comfortable with technology. For example on the Kasa spot, I found that the place to view recordings on my SD is not the same viewing place for online recordings. I subscribed online and placed an SD in the Kasa camera and so it was confusing to find the videos in different places. initially but I figured that out in a few minutes. However, I think this can be confusing for someone not tech savvy or who lacks patience to play with the app. I'm testing these to buy for my parents also and I think the Kasa camera app might just be a bit too much for someone over 60 who isn't proactively staying up to date with technology. One downside of the Kasa app is that you can't give your family access to the cameras. The only workaround is to give everyone the same log in. With EZVIZ, you can send family members an invite to see your cameras from their phone. I like sharing the cameras with my entire family, we can leverage the 2 way talking features and , it makes us feel safer. Its like having an extra set of eyes on your house if there's ever a break in. I've had this feature on my Arlo account too. I think this is a miss for Kasa based on what I've read the workaround is to just give everyone the same log on. I think the problem with this workaround is you may have family members accidentally disabling cameras or intentionally disabling them to avoid notifications whereas you may want the notifications.  24/7 recording Both offer 24/7 recording to SD of 256 with no subscription  Subscription Subscription is optional with pricing about the same if you only have one camera but when you start considering cameras all over your house on cloud, then that's where the difference counts. 1 camera on Kasa $2.99/mo vs. $3.99/mo on EZVIZ. 4 cameras on EZVIZ $10.99/mo vs. 10 cameras on Kasa $9.99/mo. As you can see, if you are planning to do cloud for backup, with multiple cameras, you get better value with Kasa.  Recording in general You must have either a subscription or an SD installed for events to be stored in both. However in the EZVIZ it will create the event alert and still image on your app even if you don\u2019t have a subscription or an SD , you just won\u2019t be able to play back the video. This means with the EZVIZ you at least know there was an event even if you have no SD and no subscription. However knowing doesn\u2019t tell you more than that and so you will have to get an SD or subscription for both to work properly  Overall, it depends on what\u2019s important to you. I\u2019m typically drawn to aesthetics which leans me more in favor of EZVIZ but because the Kasa is priced only $10 more with the holidays it makes sense to take advantage of the 2K color. I\u2019ll add some EZVIZ in the bedrooms however. There\u2019s another TP link model branded under Tapo that is $5 less without Starlight sensor, seems like a good option too!  Overall both cameras are great for the price. It really depends on what is important to you. I'm actually considering doing a mix of both cameras. I don't mind having multiple apps and already had one old 360 EZVIZ camera that I love and use to use downstairs inside my home. Based on my research Kasa and EZVIZ can integrate both on an NVR and so this is no issue to me to mix cameras.  For reference, I also have Arlo cameras outside. The reason I started looking at other camera options is because my Arlo wire free camera batteries are no longer working. I can only turn the camera on when plugged into the wall and so this changes how I can use them outside or means a lot of workarounds. After trying to find aftermarket batteries and longer plugged wires since Arlo is not selling the 1st generation parts anymore, I started looking into hardwired cameras for outside. I also want to add some cameras for my parents. I figured I'd test the cheaper inside cameras for EZVIZ and Kasa to get a feel of their products more before investing into a new system outside and installing any in my parents home. I liked both so much that I decided to add more cameras inside of my own house since they are so affordable. Read more", "I have several other Kasa cameras with the pan and tilt function and have been very satisfied with them. I needed to add another camera and didn't need the pan/tilt option so I ordered this one. It was very easy to set up and connected to my existing Kasa app flawlessly. All of my Kasa cameras are managed in the same app. The image is great and the video is smooth. I can view live or recorded video from any camera online through the app. The night vision is great, except if you have it looking through a window you will get a reflection. In that case, go into the settings and turn the night vision off and the camera's low-light capability will be plenty sufficient to show you a good and clear black & white video. In the settings you have a great amount of options to control and limit many of the camera's functions. Definitely a great camera at a fantastic price. You will also need a class 10 micro sd card in order to save and view your recordings. A 16 GB card holds several days of recordings and automatically starts over.", "I like this simple, very affordable, user friendly camera so much! I travel a lot and worry about my pets while I\u2019m gone, so the camera is set up by their food/water dishes. It can be set to detect motion and alert you if you wish, so I can easily confirm they are ok. I\u2019m not very tech savvy, so this is a great camera for me. Setup is simple. You download the Kasa app, plug in the camera, then follow the in app instructions. If your device is having trouble locating the camera to add it, and you have followed all of the other directions, look under the \u201cWi Fi\u201d section.

The cameras are 2K video capable which is an upgrade compared to many others that only provide 1080p video. The smaller size and rectangular shape is less noticeable when installed, and the field of view is very wide. Mounting the cameras is fairly easy, if you have a flat surface to secure them (You will need a separate mount to secure them to a gutter - this is also true for the solar panels). Up to 32g of video can be stored in the separate Home base which connects to an Ethernet jack on your router (The Home base is provided with the cameras). I bought a separate wireless network range extender that has an Ethernet jack for my house since my router is in the basement. The cameras connect well to the network once I extended the range and have had no issues with software updates. The AOSU app was easy to download and is pretty simple to use on my Android phone (It should work well on other phones as well) The app allows you to set-up specific features according to your requirements. You can also use two way verbal communication, turn on a light in the camera (at night the camera will switch to color if you turn on the light) sound an alarm, or disguise your voice (Make it sound deeper). I receive notifications when some motion in the cameras is detected or see a \u2018live\u2019 feed. I can also check the charge status of the internal camera batteries (Non-replaceable). The solar panel cables are attached to the.back of the panel and are not removable. The cable length was adequate for my installation. My only suggestion for improvement is for the solar panel mounts. They only allow you to position the panel in the same direction as the mounting surface since they are short in length. Also they don\u2019t hold the panels in position very well. I added a thin round rubber washer between the ball and socket inside each panel mount as well as a separate extension bracket to my panel mounts. The both work well now. Overall, I received 2 camera\u2019s, a home base, 2 solar panels, 4 mounts with screws for less than the cost of 1 solar Ring camera, and the video is better on the AOSU vs. Ring. I also don\u2019t need to pay a monthly subscription fee which was a big plus for me! So far we are very happy with this product!

I decided to try them out. I really like them! They were super easy to install. You charge them, download an app, and scan the camera. It does all the work for you. So much easier than arlo... They pick up movement well and the resolution is very good. Even at night. With the solar panels I never have to worry about charging them either but the battery life is very decent also. I love that it has a decent amount of playback time too. I will be buying these instead of arlo for my future camera needs.", "I am three days in in terms of use so still trying to tweak some settings. It was super easy to set up. I read some people had trouble after the firmware update but I did it with no issues whatsoever. The picture quality is great. Battery life has remained at 100% for both cameras thanks to the solar panel. Actually it is amazing the battery level given my cameras are recording events every two minutes.  The motion sensing is very sensitive. Our home has no line of site to road or other general human activity. I have some plantings in the line of site of both cameras and there are tree shadows also in the view for one of the cameras. We live in a windy area and the movement of the plantings and the tree shadows pick up the motion and record events (like every minute or two all day long). I have set detection zones to avoid the plantings (you can actually paint your screen with multiple zones to overcome this detection issue), but both cameras are still sensing motion. The next thing I did was set the sensitivity to the lowest setting. The latest change I made is to change the setting to \"detect humans only\", but still getting recorded events anywhere from one to five minutes apart (with no humans) - SEE UPDATE BELOW. I am not worried about storage space on the home base, but to research an event would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Oh, I don't have notifications turned on because there really would be no point with all of the false events.  I just don't know if I will keep these yet or return them. The price is good and it does provide some benefit, but I don't know whether I can feel good about the amount I spent versus what value it actually provides (fortunately Amazon gives me 30 days to decide). Final note, wifi signal strength isn't great. One camera is no more than 15 feet from my router and it was barely getting 1 bar while my iPhone next to it gets full bars. Though, there is an inner wall running perpendicular directly behind this camera. The second location gets decent wifi bars.  UPDATE: The \"Detect Humans Only\" seems to work. One camera only recorded events that had humans, the other camera still had an event where nothing transpired except for moving bushes. I think this is what most people want so I would say it works well. In my situation I would like to see the cars come and go. Maybe a future update can include \"Detect cars\" option as well (hint hint Aosu). Read more", "I recently purchased an Aosu security camera system, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations.

Took me some time to finally get the solar panels in a Sweet spot in my yard, since I have many trees to the south of me, and also getting them where the wifi signal was the strongest. that's Important. You have to remember what the camera sees is not the motion sensor area. that's on a different angle, figured that out eventually. The higher they are the better for achieving that motion angle otherwise the cameras have to be tilted up more instead of level. You can set the camera viewing area too which I just left it full screen. Played with that feature a bit but figured leave it alone. The solar panels have kept them 100% charged.

Here's why the cat one is great:  1. The set up was SO easy. One of the products I tested, it took me 20 minutes to figure out how to get it working. I was so frustrated that I had to call my friend to help me figure it out. The Furbo cat, took less than 2 minutes and it was up and running with no issues. 2. The furbo camera is situated up high on the device which makes placing the device much better. I have it on my countertop and with the other devices, I had to put it at the edge of the countertop which made me nervous that my cat would climb up and try to knock it off. The furbo's camera is higher up so I can place it in the center of my counter and still have great visibility and I have less worry that my cat will come and knock it over. There are also little stickers that you can use to keep it even more secure. 3. The picture quality & the night vision quality were the clearest/best from the ones I've tested 4. Having the camera be able to rotate, was game changing. My cat has certain spots that she likes to be and with the other cameras, I had to experiment with several spots in my house to figure out how I can see her but with the rotating camera, I did not have to be as precise with my placement. Also if you have other people in the house, if they accidentally move the camera slightly, it's not an issue. I had that happen with the cameras I was testing and when I went to check in on my cat, I couldn't see anything anymore because they had moved the device. 5. I really like that it has a date/time stamp on the video 6. At regular price, the Furbo Cat is on par with the other cameras I tested price wise. I purchased it on sale which made it a no-brainer for me.  I have a lot of friends that have a Furbo for their dog and they rave about it. Now I understand why. I'm so happy I got the Furbo cat! Read more", "I recently purchased the Furbo 360 dog camera, and I couldn't be happier with my decision! This product has truly transformed the way I interact with my furry friend.  The usability of the Furbo 360 is outstanding. Setting it up was a breeze, and the user-friendly app made it simple to connect and start using it right away. I was pleasantly surprised at how intuitive the interface is, allowing me to check in on my dog with just a few taps on my phone, whether I'm at home or away.  But what really sets the Furbo 360 apart is its treat-tossing function. My dog absolutely adores it! With the touch of a button on the app, I can send treats flying across the room, and watching my dog's excitement as he chases them down is pure joy. It's not just a treat dispenser; it's a source of entertainment and enrichment for my pup.  The Furbo 360 has enhanced the bond between my dog and me. It's like a virtual playtime, even when I can't be there in person. I've noticed my dog becoming more active and engaged when I use the treat-tossing feature. It's also been a lifesaver for alleviating separation anxiety when I'm at work or running errands.  In summary, the Furbo 360 dog camera has exceeded my expectations in terms of usability and its treat-tossing function. It's a game-changer for pet owners, providing peace of mind and a fantastic way to interact with your dog from anywhere. I highly recommend it, and I can confidently give it a 5-star rating!

The camera is able to capture the entire family room and dining room with its 360-degree view and I'm amazed of the accuracy of the auto tracking abilities. Night vision, amazing! Treat toss, perfection! I'm very pleased with this purchase and I can't wait to capture memories of my fur babies throughout the day while I'm away at work. Thank you Furbo for this upgrade...you've changed the game!", "UPDATE NOV 2020: I bought another one (when it was on sale for about 40% off, I would not pay full price if planning on using without premium features - Furbo's premium bundle may be a cheaper option if you are willing to shell out the full price) about a year and a half after my first purchase as I had to leave my first one behind in a different country when I returned home due to COVID conditions. The first time around I had the premium subscription feature, but this time I decided I only need the treat tossing and camera feature so I am currently using it on regular features. While I was on the sub, they would periodically send surveys asking things like which features would you like, how much would you be willing to pay for these features, etc. They have since taken away many of the free features and added them to the sub so obviously the rest of their clientelle is richer than I am. But they did keep the basics which is what I need so I am okay with that so far. Free feature comes with the camera (+ audio), treat tossing, voice recording to play when tossing a treat, and barking alerts. Premium features more or less make the Furbo into a security camera (person alert, alarm alert, etc.) which was useful for me on the first one because I lived on my own (it would let me know when apartment management came by to do maintenance while I wasn't home, etc.) but not so much anymore because we have a separate security camera system at my current place.  The product has not changed much (the app has updated - keep reading for app review), the camera is still great, 1080p with great night vision. Functionality has not changed either, I am using Zuke's brand training treats and it tosses out 3-5 at a time (they are 2 calories each so this is a good amount). I do not have Alexa connected to the new one so I don't know how much improvement there has been for that. The issue I had with the app is connecting the new device. The green light indicating the device was on connection mode was on but the app would do nothing when I pressed next. I spoke to the live chat help within the app but it crashed when I attempted to upload a photo of the device serial number as they requested and couldn't get back into the chat room again. They then contacted me by e-mail to follow up (good customer service on that end, though I fixed the issue on my own by then). The issue was that the app asks you for permission to access location when setting up first, but if you click on \"only this time\" instead of \"all the time\" the app will not respond for whatever reason. It connected properly once I gave it location access for \"all the time\" (I took away the permission after set up and it works fine without it). One star off for that this time because app needs some troubleshooting. I did not have many issues with the app prior to the update.  Also I recorded the same thing I had on the first camera to play when tossing a treat and my dog still recognizes it (:  ------  FIRST REVIEW AUG 2019: I bought this camera after doing a lot of research on other pet cameras. I specifically wanted one that could do wifi streaming, treat tossing, and Alexa capability. It does all those things plus night vision quality is great, but like some other reviewers mentioned Alexa does not work correctly so one star off for that (but that could also be an Alexa specific thing, as she has trouble with some of my other appliances). I mainly use it to keep an eye on my 9 month old pup who likes to eat my chairs while I'm gone to class and on my 1 month old Roomba that likes to chase her around. Works great for that purpose and night vision quality is great, much better than I originally anticipated. Treat tossing is good too, at first I used kibbles but it shoots out a lot at once so I switched to larger treats broken into pieces. My pup learned very quickly that my voice coming from it means cookies. It also doubles as a security camera with person detection.  Also the daily diary videos are a hoot! I look forward to watching them every day (: Read more", "Muy \u00fatil , por seguridad y adem\u00e1s poder dar premios a distancia es lo mejor .", " I recently added the Furbo 360\u00b0 Cat Camera to my pets parenting arsenal, and it has quickly become a game-changer. As cats owner, I always want to ensure my feline friends are happy and entertained, even when I'm not at home. The Furbo Cat Camera has exceeded my expectations in every way.  360\u00b0 Vision: The panoramic view provided by the Furbo is nothing short of amazing. It captures every nook and cranny of the room, allowing me to keep an eye on my cat's every move. Whether she's lounging on her favorite perch or engaging in a playful chase, I never miss a moment.  Crystal Clear Video: The video quality is top-notch, offering crisp and clear footage even in low light conditions. This is crucial for me, as I can easily identify my cat's behavior and ensure she's safe and content.  Interactive Features: One of the standout features is the interactive treat dispenser. It's not just a camera; it's an interactive experience. With the tap of a button on the app, I can dispense treats for my cat, turning a regular day into a delightful game. It's a fantastic way to bond with your pet, even from afar.  Two-Way Communication: The built-in microphone and speaker allow for two-way communication. I love being able to talk to my cat and hear her adorable meows in return. It provides comfort and reassurance for both of us.  Easy Setup and Intuitive App: Setting up the Furbo Cat Camera was a breeze. The user-friendly app guides you through the process, and the interface is intuitive, making it easy to navigate and access all the features.  Motion and Sound Alerts: The motion and sound alerts are a lifesaver. I receive instant notifications on my phone if anything unusual is detected, allowing me to check in and ensure my cat's well-being.  In conclusion, the Furbo 360\u00b0 Cat Camera is an investment every cat parent should consider. It offers a complete package of features that provide peace of mind, interactivity, and a closer connection with your furry friends, no matter where you are. It's more than just a camera; it's a companion for both you and your cats. Highly recommended!

Now I feel like I need to upgrade my original furbo \ud83d\ude48 the original in in the living room, the 360 in the kitchen - dining room where there's more area to cover. It's good at picking up the dogs movements and following them. Had a bit of a hard time getting the upgraded subscription working properly but it's all working fine now. Definitely recommend, ours is connected to our Alexa so if someone rings the Ring doorbell, Furbo throws some treats down automatically. Helps with door manners. \ud83d\ude0a", "I work long hours at a clinic, and I have five cats at home. Although my family helps taking care of them, I always wonder what they do while I'm away and make sure they behave. That's how I started searching for a decent cat camera and Furbo came to my sight.  It has really become a crucial part of my life since then. With Furbo, I can check on my cats from the clinic using the high-quality camera. I can even talk to them to make sure they're okay. It's like being with them, even when I'm not there.  What I love the most is the custom meowing alert feature. Furbo sends me messages when my cats' meow suddenly sounds different. It helps me to keep a close eye on my cats and lifts my anxiety. Furbo gives me peace of mind and helps me connect with my cats. If you're a busy cat owner like me, I highly recommend it.", " Liking it so far!

Video quality is much better than the bulb cameras I have. The only thing that I\u2019ve found is that when the battery gets low it disconnects from my Wi-Fi. Took me a couple of times to figure that out. The solar panel isn\u2019t the best thing because it doesn\u2019t fully charge the batteries. That became annoying fast. To solve this issue I ran a USB-C cable to it from a wall wart and haven\u2019t had any issues since. I bought a second one and I\u2019ll find out how strong the Wi-Fi signal is with it because it will be placed in my backyard. Will update after I get that one running. 13OCT23: update, I now have 2 of these cameras and when they are working they are great. They have a tendency to freeze frame about every 90 seconds or so. Then eventually my display will go black and it says to check network as if the internet has gone down. So I check my internet connection and it seems to be working fine. I know that my internet is questionable (Centurylink) so I\u2019m not using the cloud storage. Instead I\u2019m using a 64G SD card. I don\u2019t have it scheduled to record events, because on my old bulb camera I had to delete things every other day so it would stay on. This is a temporary set because I\u2019m renting now and don\u2019t want to install my wired camera system. Also I don\u2019t have Alexa so that might be the reason why I\u2019m having these issues. The video quality is exceptional even the nighttime color is great, the IR night vision is so that I can recognize someone if need be. I don\u2019t think that living in a mobile home would be an issue with the Wi-Fi @ 2.4 Ghz since it\u2019s only 15\u2019 away from the router and my other one is about 30\u2019 from the extender. My cordless phone is 2.4Ghz no issues with it outside. Wish it was compatible with my 5G Wi-Fi that works much better than the 2.4Ghz. After using it and figuring out the issues I will have to give it 4-4.5 stars overall. I would recommend it for people who don\u2019t live nor work in metal buildings or mobile homes. 15OCT23-Update II: updating again, still having issues with the camera freezing up and getting a network error. I have 2 cameras and they take turns dropping out. This morning the camera I have on my front gate dropped out 6 times in less than an hour. As I said before maybe it\u2019s the fact that I live in a mobile home and the metal is affecting it not sure. I don\u2019t have any issues with my Wi-Fi because I can walk down the road and still have my Wi-Fi service a block away (approx. 100 yards away). Also my cordless phone (2.4Ghz) works fine for the same distance. Guess I\u2019ll just go with the old fashioned way and use my wired cameras. Update #3: had the batteries charged up and plugged in the solar panel yesterday. Panel faces South and it had about 12 hours of sunlight. Sunset was about 1945 last night and sun rise was around 0655 this morning, so it was on battery power for about 11 hours. No video this morning (dead batteries). Plugged in to ac and waited a few minutes and it came back on. If and when I get my new cameras these are going back. Seems like Amazon has forgotten where I live, my first order of new cameras was sent back after it sat for a day or so about 60 miles down the road then they said it was undeliverable. Read more", " This is an updated review. My first camera didn't work as planned so I worked with the company to trouble-shoot the issues. I ended up sending in back. The company reached out and replaced it with another camera for me to try. The replacement camera worked as expected. Here my comments on quality.  Build: For the price, the quality of the camer is supberb. Nice large unit with lights, 2 antennas and a solar panel. Comes with charging cord. A 64gb MicroSD card worked in this unit the best. It is able to take 32gb-128gb. Just note, the larger card you get, the more battery it will take (finding & writing to sectors in a larger space).  Quality: The quality of the video is very good compared to some other models I've tried. I'm including a video I took in SD quality. I like to record lower quality to get better bandwidth, as my internet is moderate.  Setup: is extremely easy. Download the app, install the camera. Play around with the settings yourself, you'll learn it better. Just know that when you're setting it up, the voice on the camera is pretty loud.  Recording: You can record to Micro SD card only if you do not want to use their cloud service. I have slower internet, so I use it this way. It will record events 10s, 20s, 30s or continual. I wouldn't do continual though, because it IS a solar camera and it won't last you the night. I record at 20s, which gives me enough feed to see what's going on. You can also see LIVE view through the camera any time you want.  Placement: This camera comes with a mounting bracket and template, with a solar panel that has a nice long cable. You can mount it just about anywhere you want with the solar panel within 6' of the camera. Because it's solar, you do not need any other cords to plug it in, so you have more of a variety of places you can mount it. However, just know that it still needs wifi for you to be able to read your events.  Overall, I am giving this camera a 5-star review because customer service from this company was supberb. They helped with a problem, they helped make it right, and the replacement camera worked as expected, no problems. Customer service also kept in contact with me to make sure I had what I needed, and let me know they were there for me if I needed anything else.  If you are looking for a camera do place in an area you don't have power, give this one a try. You should be pleasantly satisfied with the results.

Moreover, I\u2019ve tried many brands of cameras, but after getting the Aosu doorbell camera, I liked it so much I got one for my family. After that I got half a dozen of Aosu pan and tilt indoor. There were things in the user interface that I didn\u2019t like and the company responded to the feedback within one update. Everything I mentioned was added! I\u2019ve never met a company that actually implemented individual feedback. Usually the company collects a bunch of feedback and if enough people ask for the same thing, then they implement it eventually.  Aosu cameras have great quality. They have something other UI don\u2019t have, which is an indication of events on the playback track itself. You can jump to an event which is coloured in blue, or you can start recording before the event (but if you want to record the event with before and after make sure you start recording slightly before the event in blue otherwise it will record the event and say \u201cfile saved\u201d). The audio is great, however I don\u2019t ever use the family call button. I use the cameras on 5 GHz internet but the good thing is you can use both! Other cameras only use 2.4. The main reason I selected Aosu is the value = pan and tilt + 2K quality. Very good price for the features you get and the user interface is quite pleasant.  The customer service is always on the ball. You can message them through Amazon or through Aosu app and they always reply and resolve. I love that. No wonder I got half a dozen cameras from them!

I record with regular indoor lighting and this camera was able to record clear video at all the available resolutions, although I typically record at 1080p 30 fps to get best results without using a ton of memory space.  The menu is easy to navigate and even though the manual does not go much into depth for describing all the menu functions, I was able to search the web and watch YouTube videos to get a better understanding of the various menu functions. For the most part, I have been using the default menu settings except for Recording Resolution, which I set for 1080P 30fps and metering mode, which I set to Matrix Metering.  The internal microphone is adequate for recording voice audio from within a few feet from the camera, but it was not what I wanted for recording music. I initially had an issue with using external microphones. I contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in responding to my inquiries and helping me resolve my issue with using external microphones. I wanted to record from two speakers that were connected to my E-Drum Kit and connecting the microphones direct to the camera using a stereo Y splitter would not work, also I could not get regular external camera microphones to work either. However, the seller gave me the information I needed to get the right equipment to record the way I wanted to record.  The camera records audio in Mono (one channel) using a 3.5mm (1/8\u201d) TRS mic jack. The camera\u2019s mic input also needed to come from a powered mic source and the mic output must be in Mono. There are many battery powered mics to be found on Amazon. I decided to get a Comica CVM-AX1 mic mixer that can take a Stereo input from two mics and output to the camera in Mono. For my shotgun mic I got a Comica V30 PRO. Both of these mic solutions work great with this camera and each of these two items cost less than $50 each.  I also upgraded the memory card to a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card for around $15  All-in-all, even with these additional items I purchased, it cost a lot less than the $500~$600 price of a brand name camera.

Here's how I had to connect: the product manual tells you to install the app, click the plus (+) sign in the top right, and the add the base station by scanning the QR code on its bottom. This is where my experience forked: it will then tell you to hit the sync buttons to connect the cameras - FIRST, USE THE PLUS SIGN TO ADD THE CAMERA IN THE APP (scan QR codes on the bottom of the cameras, like the base), THEN CONNECT VIA SYNC. I hope this saves someone else the headache. Reading the other reviews, I may be the only person with this issue.  I tried over and over with the steps listed in the manual and on the app, and sometimes the audio would even tell me they paired successfully, but I couldn't find them in the app. (I like that it gives you audio feedback, by the way). Well, after finally figuring out how they connect, I'm really happy with them.  The picture quality is great, but, it will wash out if you have a bright spot of sunlight. My property has trees, so often shaded areas appear clearly, while sunny areas are washed out. This is typical of most camera systems, though it would be nice if it could negate this with some HDR tech.  The included mounting hardware is fantastic! I like its mount, and I like that I can screw it in. I'm coming from Arlo where the magnetic mount is the only sensible way to go. I feel better having it more permanently affixed.  The one flaw that bugs me is the big power/sync button on the unit itself. I don't like that someone who could potentially reach one of the units could just turn it off or desync it. I would like this a lot better if it had a software lock in the app to turn off the camera's button functionality.  I like that the cameras are large. Conspicuous security is sometimes a deterrent in itself.  Again, coming from Arlo, I like that there's no monthly service charge, and I can keep my recordings on SD card instead of pay for a cloud service.  All in all, this is a big step up from my old Arlo system. The video quality is high, it's simple to use (excepting the preliminary sync), and there's no ongoing fees. I've been looking for an Arlo replacement for awhile, and I'm happy with this product. Read more", "The EZVIZ Outdoor Wireless Security Camera has brought peace of mind to my home like never before!

It's like having a watchful eye that never sleeps!", "I purchased a security camera before, but it requires wire, some switch box, etc. Very complex to set up. But this set is pretty 'complete' -- all you need to a wifi router at home and plug in the base. The instruction coming with the box is not that detailed, but there's a QR code to scan and get a very detailed instruction online. Pretty easy to connect the camera to the base, though I tried a couple of times -- the key is just to patiently wait, and listen to the voice notification from the devices, instead of just clicking next step on your phone. After connected, you just need a simple drilling and install the camera to where you want -- that's all! There's something a little bit annoying, that is I installed it near my front door, and whenever I go out or in, I'll receive video slips on my phone. Not sure whether there's a way to turn off the notification/not saving the videos, and just turn on when nobody at home. Another good thing is that it has a light with motion sensor. So it can be both a camera and a lighting device!", "I bought 2 of these kits, and it's true that they have good resolution and are easy to configure, but for some reason, in both, after one or two days, the cameras get disconnected and do not appear online. First one disconnects and then reappears, until it never comes back, and eventually, all 4 cameras drop out and I have to reconfigure them again. The same thing happened with the second kit despite having 100% Wi-Fi network coverage. Also, it's not realistic that they last 365 days; within a span of 2 to 3 weeks, all the cameras need to be recharged, if they even last a month.

Don't hesitate, grab a WYZE Cam Pan v3 today, and join the ranks of vigilant homeowners. Your peace of mind is just a click away! Read more", "It's inexpensive, super easy to set up and run from the phone app. Great recording quality. Lots of notification options for when it detects motion. Also small and unobtrusive, hardly notice it. As an aside. I also have an older, indoor model installed outside protected by a 1 quart clear tonic bottle over it (fits great). That indoor camera survived being outside for 2 years so far, and even survived a direct hit by hurricane Ian last year. And still going strong! Wyze will try to up-sell you into a small monthly fee to increase recording time. But I got a micro memory card and get continuous recording for 3+ days at a time, in addition to the 10 seconds you get from wyze for free.", "Excellent cameras, intuitive to set up and use, unbelievable night vision and the recordings are clear enough to be used as evidence in court. I wish the casings were a darker color, they're very easy to spot and therefore disable, I use two cameras that overlap so if someone messes with one camera the other will record it. If they're too near the edge of the WiFi range they'll compete for the WiFi, sometimes only one camera will record an incident they both should have caught, so get a booster or nest routers or something to expand the range. They handle rain just fine but if you use an extension cord get one of those waterproof boxes that protect the connection, the cameras are very sensitive to faults and will shut down if any moisture touches the plug. Every raindrop and quivering leaf triggers a recording but the app lets you adjust the sensitivity. I leave the sensitivity up, I don't mind the near constant recording because the Person/Pet/Vehicle detection is reliable, I have it set to notify me only of those events. I'm not comfortable with the company's response to the security breaches, I only use these outside but even so I don't want a stranger having access. I've used Wyze cameras (pan and stationary) side-by-side with Ring, Blink, and a couple other inexpensive options for two years and the Wyze cameras are by far the most reliable as far as actually recording events -- trespassers, wildlife, package deliveries, Wyze has never missed recording something that another brand picked up but the opposite is frequently true. I have a subscription for unlimited cameras and it's such a good deal because it doesn't restrict you to one location like Ring does, I was responsible for a couple of estate properties as well as my own home so I've had a dozen cameras on one subscription, I couldn't have afforded separate subscriptions. If you're friends with your neighbors you could all put cameras over the street and share a subscription, catch you some porch pirates.

Trae camara, cable, cuadro de energia (5V 2A), manual, chilillos de montaje, base para montar en pared/techo.  De inicio cuando las conectas se mueven, bajas la aplicacion y fueron faciles de instalar y usarlas. Por defecto tiene activado el \"Track Motion\". Le puse una memoria de 64GB. La app es facil de usar y entender. La camara se ve de buen material, se ve bien hecha y resistente.  La calidad de grabacion es decentemente buena, puedes cambiar a 360 o 720.  Los movimientos al girar la camara son suaves, puedes ver las grabaciones facilmente, acceder a ella rapidamente, grabar videos o fotos, puedes darle zoom, poner zonas de grabacion, configurar horarios, eventos, soporta IFTTT, eventos por geolocalizacion (al parecer solo USA y Canada) y otras. Las funciones avanzadas las desconozco, ya que son de paga y basicamente son: guardar en la.nube, sensores de reconocimiento avanzado, acceder por la pagina web de Wyze y otras que no.recuerdo.  Las voy a poner en el exterior y te sugieren (obligado) comprar un adaptador para exterior. Si tienes conocimientos basicos puedes hacer tu propia \"caja\" para poner el cuadro de energia cerca de la camara.  Finalmente, soportan el protocolo RTSP, el cual te permite usarlo con aplicaciones de 3ros, NVR y/o Home Assistant, incluso como camara web. Solo que lei que aun no sale.un firmware para este modelo, seguire leyendo e investigando.  2024.01.11. Con una memoria de 64GB graba aproximadamente 5 a 11 dias. La exterior tiene 5 dias La interior tiene 11 dias Ambas configuradas de la misma manera (HD, grabacion continua, sonido, eventos, vision nocturna). Supongo la diferencia principal es que con luz graba a 20FPS, y en modo nocturno graba a 15FPS, asi que la interior casi siempre tiene menos luz.

The picture quality is not like an HDTV, nor would you expect that from a camera system so moderately priced, but the overall quality is still more than good enough to observe what is going on in the area where you have set it up. The speaker system works well, as you can both speak and be heard through it. Once again, it should be noted that this is not an expensive home security system and therefore expectations should not be unreasonable.

I think its a great value.", "MUBVIEW Baby Monitor with Camera and Audio. Let's start the review with an overall design. I love the look and the feel of it. Little elegant looking camera that looks like a furniture accent, blends well with the interior. Good quality device.Comes with instructions, a mounting bracket and screws, and a USB/AC plug.  One could stand it on a surface or screw to the ceiling upside down (in the settings you would need to flip the screen). The electrical cable is relatively somewhat short, but since it's a USB, you could potentially get an extension USB cable (not included). This camera must be plugged in at all times to function.  The quality of the still images is superb, even in night mode, and the live feed is very good. You can select between qualities of the pictures, but keep in mind it will consume your SD card faster at HD images. The two way audio is good quality, you need to press a mike button on your phone, to speak, but the camera speaker is always on. There is a bit of a lag in audio/video, but that is normal from my experience. You could make screenshots and instantly share them, which is very convenient. You can zoom with your fingers off the screen. Remotely controlling the camera is easy, and effective, it rotates almost full circle, and has a good range top to bottom. If installed right, the camera can overlook the entire room on its own. Great peripheral field of view. Also of note the night mode takes pictures and has a live feed in black and white, versus daytime is in colour.  I couldn't find the sd card slot initially, its hidden behind the lens, you would have to roll the lens all the way up (see the pictures). Unfortunately The sd card is not included, so i could not test it with it, i would have to buy one later. The installation is fairly straightforward, you download the app, and follow the instruction wizard, register, connect and you are good to go. Plenty of languages for your interface to chose from (see pics).  Motion detection works well (i turned it off because every time the dog walks by it sends you a message, which is good if you need this working well). Easy access from the app to the live feed, no authentication needed, which on certain products is quite annoying.  The recording and data storage available in 2 options: SD card, or cloud storage. The amazon product description ad mentions a free 7 day loop recording storage cloud, but all i could find is an offer for a subscription, I will be calling the customer service to verify this information, because it is a little confusing (see pictures).

The camera in its entirety is actually pretty good for the price but of course it has its flaws.  I will say that this camera doesn\u2019t hook up to wifi for some reason. I\u2019ve tried looking for videos and everything but nothing worked. I feel like this camera is a different version than what other people on social media have but aside from the camera not hooking up to wifi or bluetooth, the camera is pretty good.  The basic settings are easy to change and everything! But i also wanna say that the color settings for when you\u2019re making a video is a bit frustrating.  Like i could be recording in my house in the daytime with the natural lighting and no camera flash on and if i have the screen color setting on \u201cauto\u201d, it would make me look rather pale/lifeless and make the room look gloomy rather than vibrant like how it would be outside. and then if i were to change the screen color setting to \u201csunny\u201d, it would make me look orange in the house (refer to the video) and still make outside look a vibrant. so the settings are rather confusing so i would definitely pay attention to that when making videos.  and lastly, i wanna say that you definitely are gonna need a good microphone. it sounds veryyyyy muffled without one. but honestly if you get the mic and have your camera settings set to your preference for taking vids/pics, you got yourself a great vlogging camera for under $100! WHO\u2019S GONNA BEAT THAT BRO??  overall, everything is pretty cool with this camera and i would get it as someone who doesn\u2019t wanna pay for a super great quality camera like Sony or Canon, especially considering that i\u2019m JUST starting to vlog and is trying to get the hang of things. :) Read more", "I brought this camera for my niece and she loves it. It\u2019s lightweight, takes good pics/videos and the perfect size. It\u2019s clear and durable. Not hard to function at all. LOVEEE IT!", "I purchased this camera to take action shots for athletes.

I absolutely love the wifi feature however, it is so easy to download pictures straight to your phone.", "It had really bad quality with everything. The picture on the camera was extremely blurry. The sound was so bad too. It sounded like the people talking in the video were underwater and they couldn\u2019t be heard. I would not recommend buying this camera.

Very easy and quick start up, allows you to change picture quality settings as well. Only took three days to receive after purchasing", "I bought this hoping to get better video of my daughter's choir concerts. This camera is good for close up videos, not far away. Sound is also awful without buying a mic. My samsung 20 takes better video and audio. I'll use this for stills and video in small rooms only. If I am too close to a speaker it blasts out my sound, but not close enough and I can't hear anything. If you are going to vlog yourself, this could be a good camera. Whenever I zoom I get graining pictures, even with using a tripod. Video won't auto focus, I can't keep holding down the button the whole time.", "Camera feel super light and made with low end product. This is more so a beginner friendly camera or for someone who just want memories to record and doesn't care bout it being a1 quality. You get what you pay for kinda product.

Also, the menu is clunky and kind of hard to navigate. I remember reading extensively before I purchased a camera because I knew my son would want one that allowed him to make slo-mo videos- something he loves to use my iphone for. I read that this camera had that capability. However, as I was working my way through the camera menu, I wasn't able to find how to use that feature. Perhaps it is actually there, but if so, it's buried under so many layers of clicks and settings it's not very user friendly. I had hoped the features like that would have been a little more obviously accessible since this camera is marketed largely to kids.  So, I'm somewhat disappointed in the item, but my 7 year old doesn't know the difference and he is having fun with it. So, I guess that's all that matters!

Read more", "The OBSBOT Tiny Webcam works well as advertised, it is great in low-light settings and tracks very well. I am using this camera on a Mac with Monterey and it does work fine. You will need to download the latest operating software for the OBSBOT for MacOS Monterey in order for this to work properly. I did however have an issue with the firmware crashing when trying to be updated on the Mac.  After emailing them, they responded in an acceptable length of time and stated that they were aware of a bug that was causing this and would have an update soon. When the update came out, it seemed to get farther into the update but still crashed towards the end, luckily, it seemed to take the update once rebooted. I still think they need some work done on the software to make this work better.  The OBSBOT seems to work across a range of applications with no issues. I primarily use it for Zoom and Facetime and it works very well. The resolution and clear video is a major upgrade from my aging 720P built-in webcam on the iMac. I would definitely recommend this for anyone wanting to upgrade their video conference game.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because of the firmware update issues. I have just connected it to my Windows laptop and installed the software and did it that way. If they can get this worked out on macOS then it would be a 5-star product. Read more", " I've been using this webcam for a while now, and I must say, the tracking feature is nothing short of amazing. I even tried playing hide and seek with it to lose the tracking, but it always wins, no kidding! It's so accurate and responsive; it tracks your movements flawlessly. And here's a fun tidbit - if you leave the tracking on and step out of the room, it will follow you! That's right; it's like having a personal camera crew wherever you go.  But what's even more impressive is the option to set up zone tracking. This allows you to define specific areas or zones where you want the camera to focus its tracking. It's perfect for those times when you want to keep the tracking on but don't want the camera to follow you everywhere.  One of my favorite extra features that the software includes is the built-in background blur. It's a game-changer! This feature ensures that you have a consistent background blur no matter which applications you're using. And for those apps that don't offer a blur option, this webcam's software has got you covered. It's super easy to use their blur function, and it looks just as good as the real thing.  Oh, and don't forget that it comes with a detachable monitor/laptop mount. This mount is incredibly versatile; you can adjust it to fit almost any size monitor or laptop. Plus, it's detachable, so you can remove it if you don't need it.  In summary, this webcam is a fantastic addition to my setup. The tracking is out of this world, the background blur is a game-changer, and the versatility of the monitor/laptop mount is a huge plus. If you're in the market for a high-quality webcam with these features, look no further. Highly recommended! Read more", "I tried several of their models before going 'in' on this one.

But not 100% if it should be this expensive. All in all, good. Note that a 360 camera with tracking can do a lot ... when compared to this. Still I am happy with the purchase.", "La Tiny 2 es una webcam que ha superado las expectativas que ten\u00eda. Desde el momento del desempaquetado te das cuenta de que es un producto premium y esas sensaciones se mantienen en todo momento, claro que al principio su precio puede parecer algo elevado, pero una vez que la pruebas y ves todas las funciones, as\u00ed como la calidad que ofrece, la cosa cambia bastante.  En principio la calidad de imagen es muy buena, sobre todo al grabar en 4K a 30fps, aunque puedes bajar la resoluci\u00f3n y llegar a los 60fps, es a tu preferencia, en mi caso la he utilizado principalmente a 4K y he quedado muy satisfecho, no \u00fanicamente con la claridad y nitidez, sino tambi\u00e9n con el enfoque autom\u00e1tico, as\u00ed como con los micr\u00f3fonos. Pero todo esto no es lo \u00fanico que la hace tan buena, y es que incorpora un gimball de dos ejes, as\u00ed como inteligencia artificial, con la cual podr\u00e1 seguirte para que siempre est\u00e9s encuadrado, tiene diversos modos en cuanto a los planos que puedes grabar, y claro que de forma manual puedes ajustar la posici\u00f3n de la Tiny 2, as\u00ed como el zoom.  Tiene distintos ajustes en el modo belleza, diversos filtros y puedes configurar la exposici\u00f3n, el ISO, contraste, entre otras cosas. Pero s\u00ed no quieres enrollarte con todo eso, no hace falta, ya que la c\u00e1mara es plug and play, as\u00ed que no hace falta descargar drivers y tampoco la app, aunque en lo personal lo recomiendo, pues es muy intuitiva y con ella le puedes sacar m\u00e1s partido.  Lo \u00fanico que podr\u00eda reprocharle es que el fondo desenfocado no me funcion\u00f3 en Windows y que al grabar desde el software de OBSBOT en mi MacBook Pro, los v\u00eddeos ten\u00edan retraso, pero al usar cualquier otra aplicaci\u00f3n como Discord, Teams, OBS, etc, nunca tuve problema.  Aunque no es una webcam para todo el mundo, por su precio, s\u00ed considero que es una excelente opci\u00f3n en caso de que tengas un Home Office, que te requiera estar en videollamadas, tambi\u00e9n s\u00ed eres un creador de contenido o stremear, esta Tiny 2 es m\u00e1s que suficiente en t\u00e9rminos de calidad de imagen. Bajo esos escenarios, me parece que realmente vale lo que cuesta, porque comprar una DSLR o Mirrorless que te permita grabar a 4K por este precio, es pr\u00e1cticamente imposible, adem\u00e1s de que tendr\u00edas que hacer la inversi\u00f3n en otros accesorios, mientras que con esta webcam no tienes que enrollarte mucho, s\u00f3lo la conectas y listo, adem\u00e1s de que puedes transportarla con suma facilidad.  En conclusi\u00f3n, es un producto excelente y yo que soy creador de contenido en YouTube he disfrutado mucho del producto, y pienso usarla para diversos proyectos, no la recomendar\u00eda a todo el mundo, pero s\u00ed quieres una webcam con una calidad de imagen incre\u00edble, que literalmente est\u00e1 al nivel de c\u00e1maras mucho m\u00e1 caras y piensas sacarle partido, es una gran opci\u00f3n, en lo personal estoy muy contento con la compra. Read more", "I absolutely love this Webcam... Quality of image is excellent... the tools where you can get it to track and follow your face, your hand, your desk etc is truly breathtaking. Its great for Zoom, MS Teams and Recording your own screen-recording videos/tutorials.  I use a Macbook Pro 8-core 4TB HDD 32GB RAM Radeon Pro Vega 4GB graphics card and with my setup there has been no issues until I decided to start using the Obsbot Webcam Desktop App.  The webcam works seemlessly without the app on... but after watching several videos about using the Webcam most showed using the Obsbot Webcam - which again has lots of functionalities.  You can set specific camera zoom and settings as a choice of 3-presets so no setups are needed once you find your preferred sweatspot. You can set tracking, zoom levels, focus levels, shutterspeed, white balance, contrast, saturation, etc and choose certain beauty filters to make your face or body shape more aesthetically pleasing and many other options.  So I started having this app open as it gave me so much more control on the webcam.  However when recording videos for some promos and tutorials my Mac kept freezing after 10 or so minutes, with the only solution turning my mac off and back on... very frustrating.  I opened Activity Monitor and kept it open on one of my monitors whilst trying again. To my surprise the Obsbot app for some random reason was using up 86-93% of my CPU. I searched the Obsbot forums, searched Google etc and could not find any solutions.  The app does not give options to limit the % of CPU it uses... it just eats it all up when recording a video and because my screen-recording software has to use some of the CPU also the Macbook freezes and my recording is scrapped once again.  I have no idea why the Obsbot app needs to use so much of my CPU power. Yes it has lots of features but many people use a lower spec of computer than me... so I am sure it does not need to use everything it is in my experience. It even crashes Zoom calls with the App open.  So sadly I have had to use the Obsbot webcam without the app open... which does limit what you can do with this amazing piece of kit.  My Macbook is using OS Sonoma... so perhaps the issue lies with the Obsbot software not being optimised for Sonoma usage.  So overall, as long as you are not using a Mac with OS Sonoma... this webcam will be the best webcam you've ever purchased. I would still recommend this webcam as nothing else comes close... and hopefully sometime in the future the software issues will be addressed. It might work better on a Windows PC but I have not tested that so I can't comment for certain.

I dont know if this was a \"growing pains\" situation gor the app/software, or if this was a genuine issue that worked itself out somehow. But either way I have not had any deal breaker type of issues with this camera in many months now, and it has been recording away 24/7 in the position I set it to point now for a while. Definitely a good purchase for the $20-ish price range compared to others I the same range. Updating my original review below from 2 stars to 4 stars at this point... not 5, only because there are still things the hardware is more than capable of doing that are not available due to the software or cannot be used unless you pay blurams additional money for their cloud services that no one really needs, as long as you own an sd card, and that shouldn't be aloud to be a thing... unfortunately though, all cameras in this price range have this same exact featureless software to control it without paying the company's extra for cloud recording. They've pretty much all adopted this type of business model now, so I can't knock blurams in particular more than just 1 star for that alone. Deffinately didn't expect this camera to last recording to SD on 24/7 loop like it had been for longer than a few momths. Overall it's a smart device that I havent toyed around with or had to opem the app for any reason at all in momths now, which is what your aiming for with any smart device. Pleasantly surprised with this little burams camera hardware. Not at all impressed with the software, but also not wntirely dissapointed either. More control and capabilitiesthan most others, IF you pay the $2/momthly subscription. Whis is extremely reasonably priced by the way, but It's not the cost i take issue with, its the deceptive sales model that seemingly all sub $100 camera brands have all adopted at this point.*  The camera will not re-center itself after motion detection, and gets stuck looking at a blank wall. Only way yo fix this is to stop recording to SD and use cloud uploads only for it to function properly is what I've learned after being on my 3rd replacement device now. If you turn off the motion tracking feature and just leave it in one position though it seems to work just fine with SD recording, BUT.... the push notifications for qhen it fetes a person, motion, ect. Are instant when only recording to the cloud, and are delayed by a full minute at least when you have \"playback from SD\" selected in the settings.  Yo sum it up the hardware is great and works great without an SD card in it, but given its features and 90% of people buy this for that exact selling point of having an SD card slot and not having to rely on a cloud service - The firmware for these blurams cameras needs to be updated BADLY because I really do like the device but it's seemingly being overloaded by recording HQ TO the SD card at the same time that it is uploading to the cloud and it just overloads it to the point where the auto tracking feature and re-entering functions of the actual hardware get canceled out like ctrl+alt+del on a computer because it just dosent have the available resources to handle all of this at once... ice came home everyday the past week now yo my camera being on with the night vision on, but the actually lens pointed all the way up into the off position and who knows how long it was this way for? So clearly that not acceptable and this issue needs to be fixed. If it ever get a firmware update to allow the primary record and playback from to be the SD card and make the cloud uploads a secondary backup that the camera uploads when it is proccessing nothing else, that's all it would take to make this a perfect camera and I would change my review to 5 stars... but as it currently sits, this I not an auto motion tracking camera if you plan to use an SD card and I almost feel like they know this and have the firmware designed this way purposely to sell their (fairly priced & good) cloud services, which I absolutely refuse and purposely bought this camera because of the SD card slot. I do not want my entire 2.4ghz band of my network being maxed out around the clock because of a little security camera, which is exactly what happens anytime it records an event unless you turn the cloud recording off....and once you turn it off from what I read in the app. Rhee is no way to reactivate your remaining trial time and you just lose it so \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f FIX YOUR PURPOSELY BROKEN FIRMWARE BLURAMS.

The feed cuts out too often, the visual is sometimes / often black and requires numerous app closures and re-starts.... can ou imagine if you are recording and you see somebod stealing your stuff and the feed constantly cuts out / resets? The devioce often disconnected and kept resetting....  I replaced it with the Decko equivalent model. Sad because IMo the Blu rams unti actually looks etter, rotates better etc... but the decko unit WORKS.  This is not the end though... I will keep the BR unit since i own it and will just keep it to see how it continues to degrade... or improve??? with time.  The Decko unit is not without flaws.... but it works so much better. The night vision is better, the feed and controls work as well...i think the BR has better controls.. .but they do not / hardly work.  2/14/23  Still updating / getting whatever money I can out of these junks.  Currently getting a lot of \"oops device has disconnected\" messages when devices are literally right next to the wifi routers. and viewing device has excellent recption etc...  The camera seems to restart randomly.. It loses connection and literally performs the self test in the middle of viewing.  Using it to watch some baby animals and it freezes, picture cuts to black / app needs restarting and the camera movement crashes the whole app.  it just gets \"better\" as time goes by... better meaning worse!!!!!!!  update:  oct2022: At this point im just keeping it to update for other people...why not? The connwection is still bad and controls are mediocre at best.... the decko isnt outstanding but has more control over this unit.  It still has problem loading a picture... yet the ads load flawlessly. I wanted to check on m birds.. but couldnt as the little \"spinning circle\" just kept spinning.  Voice / sound is poor... why even have it as an option?  Sionce getting the deckop units several monts ago, this unit has failed and needed to be readded to the ap pseveral times... 3 times n a few months. The decko units thus far havent had an issue like that.  For the price, this camera is good. It has a lot of features for $25...even if it cost more the amount of features would be impressive....The night vision, I'd say is excellent, I've tested the two side by side literally and the alerts are faster and instantaneous compared to Dekco brand cameras, and there a few features that IMO make Bluerams great.. .but really, that's all there is to say. the app is filled with non stop ads to subscribe to cloud services, you can only watch maybe 15 seconds of live video, the reaction to controls is incredibly slow and inaccurate, it takes forever to load visuals.... and it freezes etc.. as I type this i can see the little \"loading\" circle going and going.. . When you get a notice that someone is potentially stealing your crap, you don;t want ot watch a 10?? second ad before you can view your cameras... Im not paying for cloud services yes, but I want to be able to see instantaneous feed... especially if I get a notice saying someone has appeared in my garage.... I understand they want to promote it but almost every time I check my camera or get a notice?  Overall I am quite disappointed. I have since started switching over to Dekco brand camers. Although those are also far from flawless. Id say they at least perform better and more reliably. One big advantage the Bluerams has over the dekco is that you can use the app to switch what wifi the unit is using. thats good if you have several different networks to choose from. Overall though, that one big advantage does not make it the superior unit.... very disappointed with these units. I have 3 of them and all 3 are the same. I also have the outdoor unit which was also disappointing. So far, for a similar price, the Decko units have performed well, have similar featuers, and have recently added more features that make it beeter than these... If you want my advice, get the Dekco units.  Updat: 8/31/22 Looks like the units have stopped working and have all \"disconnected\" It looks liek I will need to manually add the cameras again.... The reason why I am keeping these two onboard as compared to just repalceing them with Decko units is 1. I paid for them 2. they are in areas that aren;t that important.  So far the Deckos have been trouble free and they even updated the app which includes a manual light override, and a better 2 way ommunication option.  The ad advertising seems to have gotten more annoying / often as they try to advertise to you to buy cloud space. Read more", "I love this when I am not home to watch over my cat! It is very sensitive to loud noises and movements. It will send me notifications if it senses something small like noises from outside on the street. It records all day and it's easy to use!

When the camera arrived it was well packaged and the supplied instructions easy to follow. I had it connected to our home network very quickly and the mounting template meant it was mounted in minutes.  Once setup the app was easy to use and the picture provided clear. Night vision worked well and the motion tracking a lovely (if sometime intermittent) feature.  The app only records a certain amount of 'footage' unless you go for one of the subscriptions but as we are just using to check up on the pets we didn't need a lot.

The camera's sleek design also blends seamlessly into my home decor.", "I\u2019ve been looking for a while now to buy a security camera for my home, and when I first spotted this camera, I loved it right away. I loved how it looked, I thought it looked really cute, and would look great in my home. I usually don\u2019t buy anything that has negative reviews, but because I really liked the look of this security camera, I decided to take my chances and buy it anyways\u2026 After all, it did have SOME good reviews too\u2026 What could possibly go wrong that I cannot get fix? My boyfriend\u2019s an electrician\u2026 He can fix pretty much anything! Well\u2026 let me tell you what a huge mistake that was!!! First of all, when I first got the camera, it kept on having trouble finding and connecting to my wifi network. When it finally connected, after about 7 or 8 tries, it disconnected for no reason a few hours later! So I had to reconnected it\u2026 again, it took another 7 or 8 tries, only to have it disconnect AGAIN a few hours later!!! For no reason!!! I thought maybe I was doing something wrong, so I got my boyfriend to come over to help set it up, and it ALSO took him a few tries before it would connect. So I thought, \u201cHA! This should be ok now!\u201d\u2026 But guess what?? After a few hours, it disconnected AGAIN for no reason!!! Now, I\u2019m REALLY PISSED OFF! So I got my boyfriend to come over to set it up for me again, and guess what? This time, it wouldn\u2019t connect to my wifi network at all!!! After about 15 tries, we finally gave up. This camera is an absolute piece of crap, and the only place it belongs is in the garbage. I will never buy another Blurams again, nor do I recommend any of their products. Totally useless piece of junk!  EDIT: Seller is extremely nice! He contacted me and apologized for the defective security camera I received, and offered to send me another one free of charge!!! My boyfriend helped me install the new security camera, and so far (it\u2019s been a week), it seems to work ok. So I\u2019m changing the one-star rating to a four-star. I really appreciate and loved the fact that the seller is willing to stand behind his products\u2026 And is willing to make amends if something goes wrong! Because of this, I would buy from this seller again! Read more", "I did consider purchasing a more expensive camera going by the rule 'you get what you pay for'. However, given the reviews outside of Amazon online (I don't always trust Amazon reviews these days) I thought I would give it a go. I have to say so far, after 2 weeks, I have been pleasantly surprised. The camera has been excellent. I use it to keep an eye on my puppy when I am out of the house. The night and day vision is hard to fault and every time there is significant movement or sound I am notified immediately. The delay from reality to viewing on your phone is hardly noticeable, I'd say about half a second. Likewise, the audio from the camera to phone and visa-versa is the same slight delay, but always in sync with the display. Already, it has proven its worth. I was checking in on my dog and noticed it was out of its pen. I scrolled the camera around and saw it eating the plants. I came home immediately before it could do any more damage. On another occasion, I checked in on the camera and noticed the dog attempting to get out. I used the talk through option (very simple to use, just select 'talk') and told him to stop, he heard my voice and thankfully obeyed (I think he thought he wasn't being watched). I have also used the camera to effectively guide my children through a problem while I was out, again using the talk through option. Of course, all this requires good wifi for the camera and good signal from your phone.  When buying a camera like this, it's actually not that easy knowing where to start given there are so many at so many price points. In my opinion, it would be hard to get better value for money. It deserves a solid 4/5. Perhaps I am being a little harsh here, but for me what stops it from being a 5/5 is the fact that:  1. The initial advert when you log on to the app (it can be skipped after 3 second) 2. The Micro USB. (We all know the USB C provides a more solid connection that can take a few knocks) 3. The camera travels in the opposite direction when screen scrolling with your finger. (However, navigation through the app's circular pad option is better and works well and achieves 360 viewing).  Otherwise, the camera and integrated app is effective, functional and usable. Providing it keeps going for a few years, it's worth every penny at \u00a325. If I need another camera, I would buy this camera again without hesitation as points 1-3 aren't a deal breaker for me. Read more", "For the most part the camera has very good resolution and tracking works great too. However, I had an issue with my camera microphone staying on even after turning it off through settings. Contacted customer service back and forth with multiple emails for OVER 3 weeks. In the end they didn\u2019t even solve it for me and I ended up having to fix it by myself by just factory resetting the camera (lost all settings and shared invites). Customer service asked me what I did in return for free membership for 2 or 3 months. I gave that to them and they didn\u2019t even bother giving me the free membership mentioned, basically just ghosted me. Long story short, it\u2019s a great camera until you have to reach out to their abysmal support. Update Dec 26,2023: Well they emailed me offering me a refund and all I had to do was respond to their email. I did that and it\u2019s been over a week and their support still hasn\u2019t emailed back or even sent me the refund they promised. Definitely stay away from this brand if you think you\u2019ll need to use their tech support or if you\u2019ll need to contact customer service. Such a disappointment. Final update January 9, 2024: I eventually managed to get the free cloud service they mentioned and it turns out there was another option within the app in order to get it to work. However, as for getting my refund that hasn't even happened. I already gave them my order information and they keep claiming that they are \"checking on it\" but at the same time it's been another week and the refund is still no where to be seen on my credit card transactions. On top of that they still keep asking me to change my review even though nothing has been resolved for me through them. At this point I don't even expect them to give me my refund and additionally I ended up having to factory reset my camera a SECOND time even with their \"update\" due to the fact that the camera microphone issue came back a second time.

So far the picture quality is very nice, sharp and crisp resolution. There is a 5k resolution but it's not 16 by 9 it is square in 4 by 3 and only at 15 FPS so that is something to consider.

I was expecting to receive a subpar camera as the price is pretty low, but the camera has great quality, easy smart phone assess, easy setup, and great resolution. I have already bought two because of how simple and easy it was to setup and use. The two way talk function is spectacular as I have used it to communicate with both a family member and my pet. It allows me to easily check on both of them in seconds. The human detection and motion tracking features also work exactly as advertised. The app will alert me whenever someone walks in front of the camera and will track the person which lets me feel confident that I won't miss a thing. I would 100% recommend this product for it's low price, but incredible quality!", "This is a good camera system for the price and ease of use. I have two of them set up to observe my pets while we are away on vacations or long outings, and they work just fine. Even at night, the picture is still clear enough to see what's going on. This camera does have a motion detection feature, but be aware that it is not a continuous video once motion is detected, but instead a screenshot and a message notifying the user that there has been movement. The picture quality is not like an HDTV, nor would you expect that from a camera system so moderately priced, but the overall quality is still more than good enough to observe what is going on in the area where you have set it up. The speaker system works well, as you can both speak and be heard through it. Once again, it should be noted that this is not an expensive home security system and therefore expectations should not be unreasonable. For the moderate price, you get a good and reliable camera system, and if your needs are simple this will work just fine for you. I am happy with the system and plan to add one more camera. Connectivity to the app, as well as the usability of the overall system, is fairly easy.", "perfect live cam and so easy to use with the app on my phone. Intercom works well too. I think its a great value.", "MUBVIEW Baby Monitor with Camera and Audio. Let's start the review with an overall design. I love the look and the feel of it. Little elegant looking camera that looks like a furniture accent, blends well with the interior. Good quality device.Comes with instructions, a mounting bracket and screws, and a USB/AC plug.  One could stand it on a surface or screw to the ceiling upside down (in the settings you would need to flip the screen). The electrical cable is relatively somewhat short, but since it's a USB, you could potentially get an extension USB cable (not included). This camera must be plugged in at all times to function.  The quality of the still images is superb, even in night mode, and the live feed is very good. You can select between qualities of the pictures, but keep in mind it will consume your SD card faster at HD images. The two way audio is good quality, you need to press a mike button on your phone, to speak, but the camera speaker is always on. There is a bit of a lag in audio/video, but that is normal from my experience. You could make screenshots and instantly share them, which is very convenient. You can zoom with your fingers off the screen. Remotely controlling the camera is easy, and effective, it rotates almost full circle, and has a good range top to bottom. If installed right, the camera can overlook the entire room on its own. Great peripheral field of view. Also of note the night mode takes pictures and has a live feed in black and white, versus daytime is in colour.  I couldn't find the sd card slot initially, its hidden behind the lens, you would have to roll the lens all the way up (see the pictures). Unfortunately The sd card is not included, so i could not test it with it, i would have to buy one later. The installation is fairly straightforward, you download the app, and follow the instruction wizard, register, connect and you are good to go. Plenty of languages for your interface to chose from (see pics).  Motion detection works well (i turned it off because every time the dog walks by it sends you a message, which is good if you need this working well). Easy access from the app to the live feed, no authentication needed, which on certain products is quite annoying.  The recording and data storage available in 2 options: SD card, or cloud storage. The amazon product description ad mentions a free 7 day loop recording storage cloud, but all i could find is an offer for a subscription, I will be calling the customer service to verify this information, because it is a little confusing (see pictures).  Overall we are very satisfied with the product, its priced fair, and performs well. 5/5 Read more", "Wir haben uns f\u00fcr zwei dieser Kameras entschieden, um unseren Hund in unserer Abwesenheit beobachten zu k\u00f6nnen.

It was pretty easy to set up when you follow the instructions and the video quality is also good (both day time and night vision). The one thing that I would note (and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that is does not come with an SD card which you need for storage. If you don't use an SD card, you'll have to sign up for cloud storage which has a subscription cost.

The install is easier on this model only requiring two screws with wall anchors (if needed) to install. The screws could be a little longer, but they are adequate.

I purchased 3 cameras and I would definitely recommend but there are a few things I wish would improve. The cameras are very clear in the day and at night. They pick up any type of motion and I love the pan, tilt, zoom. BUT, I wish the pan, tilt, zoom would move automatically on its own rather than me having to do it in the app. These cameras are not totally wireless because you have to use the solar panel which has a wire to it and it makes the camera look ugly. I had to hide the wires somehow from the solar panel. It is great to have to not use batteries and change them out vs. having the solar panel which does hold a great charge. But I wish the camera had a solar feature inside it or on top of it. The customer service people are very prompt by email. I bought 3 SD cards for these cameras so I can go back and view the history on the videos. These cameras should definitely come with these SD cards. There is no subscription, set up was easy, and I have great WI-FI through direct TV. Cameras do not buffer, they come on pretty quickly when I access the app. At night, when I pull in the driveway, the light on the camera comes on, which I like. It is super sensitive and picks up any motion. People walking, dogs running, trucks or cars coming down the street. Oh and I also think that there should be a little booklet with the icon definitions that explain what certain icons means. I emailed them asking them and they were knowledgeable about the icons. Overall, these cameras are great for a great price. But the wires from the solar panel get on my nerves!!!! I wonder if I can disconnect the panel and only use them when the cameras need charging???

This time I bought them with solar panels. It is too early to talk about solar panels performance, so I leave that to the next review I am going to make, so this time my review is about security cameras and software. Now I have cameras from all 4 sides of my house, and I think that gives me good protection from intruders. I confirm the security cameras are solidly constructed, reliable and the software works well. The battery capacity seems good. The cameras are easy to install, the image quality is very good and cameras react pretty good for any movements. The iegeek customer support is responsive, I used it once because of my misunderstanding. They were able to help quickly. All this together with reasonable pricing creates a great value of iegeek security cameras.", "This is my first security camera that I bought and so far I am quite impressed with all the features it offers ie. clear picture and video both during the day and at night, ability to remotely change the angle of the camera, ease of installation, unit can be powered by solar panel which holds the battery charge very well, which so far saved me an additional step of electrical hookup.

First off, I was pleasantly surprised by the packaging \u2013 it was sturdy and well-designed, which is always a good start.  One of the standout features of this camera is its super lightweight design, making it incredibly easy to carry around. This is perfect for on-the-go photography and vlogging. However, I ultimately decided to return it, not because of any flaws in the camera itself, but because I wanted a more high-end camera for my specific needs.  That being said, I must admit that this camera offers a lot of great features for its $100 price point. The 4K resolution and 48MP capability provide excellent image quality, and the 16X digital zoom allows for versatile framing options. I appreciated the inclusion of a 32GB Micro SD card and two batteries, which added to the overall value.  Additionally, the camera comes with a 52mm wide-angle lens and a macro lens, offering versatility for different types of photography. The manual focus option is a nice touch for those who prefer more control over their shots.  In summary, if you're a student or someone looking for a compact and budget-friendly camera with a good set of features, this camera is certainly worth considering. Its lightweight build and the included accessories make it a great option for beginners or those on a tight budget. However, if you're looking for top-tier performance, you may want to explore higher-end models. Read more", "I bought this camera to record my drum practice sessions and I needed to buy at a budget price. This camera met my needs to perform this function.  I record with regular indoor lighting and this camera was able to record clear video at all the available resolutions, although I typically record at 1080p 30 fps to get best results without using a ton of memory space.  The menu is easy to navigate and even though the manual does not go much into depth for describing all the menu functions, I was able to search the web and watch YouTube videos to get a better understanding of the various menu functions. For the most part, I have been using the default menu settings except for Recording Resolution, which I set for 1080P 30fps and metering mode, which I set to Matrix Metering.  The internal microphone is adequate for recording voice audio from within a few feet from the camera, but it was not what I wanted for recording music. I initially had an issue with using external microphones. I contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in responding to my inquiries and helping me resolve my issue with using external microphones. I wanted to record from two speakers that were connected to my E-Drum Kit and connecting the microphones direct to the camera using a stereo Y splitter would not work, also I could not get regular external camera microphones to work either. However, the seller gave me the information I needed to get the right equipment to record the way I wanted to record.  The camera records audio in Mono (one channel) using a 3.5mm (1/8\u201d) TRS mic jack. The camera\u2019s mic input also needed to come from a powered mic source and the mic output must be in Mono. There are many battery powered mics to be found on Amazon. I decided to get a Comica CVM-AX1 mic mixer that can take a Stereo input from two mics and output to the camera in Mono. For my shotgun mic I got a Comica V30 PRO. Both of these mic solutions work great with this camera and each of these two items cost less than $50 each.  I also upgraded the memory card to a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card for around $15  All-in-all, even with these additional items I purchased, it cost a lot less than the $500~$600 price of a brand name camera.

I love the solar panels, so my wife and I don't have to worry about replacing batteries for putting me cameras outside and having to run a power cord through the window. The solar panels are pretty small and we have them on the edge of the roof.  We have one outside in the front pointed at our cars and the street, and another one in the backyard pointing mainly at our shed.  Much better video than the old 720p cameras we had before. It has two-way sound, alert sound, a small floodlight that you can choose to go off every time motion is detected, and a text every time motion is detected. It's a great buy.

The installation was pretty much a breeze, just might depend from case to case how and where you install your cameras. I opted for a solar panel to charge my cameras, and they work very well! The quality is good and the features all work as advertised! The wireless setup process was pretty smooth. I\u2019d say motion detection works 90% of the time, i think it depends how you position your camera bc the instructions does state that tracking side to side works better than something approaching the camera head on. The app itself is also pretty good, pretty user friendly and easy to setup.

I purchased 3 cameras and I would definitely recommend but there are a few things I wish would improve. The cameras are very clear in the day and at night. They pick up any type of motion and I love the pan, tilt, zoom. BUT, I wish the pan, tilt, zoom would move automatically on its own rather than me having to do it in the app. These cameras are not totally wireless because you have to use the solar panel which has a wire to it and it makes the camera look ugly. I had to hide the wires somehow from the solar panel. It is great to have to not use batteries and change them out vs. having the solar panel which does hold a great charge. But I wish the camera had a solar feature inside it or on top of it. The customer service people are very prompt by email. I bought 3 SD cards for these cameras so I can go back and view the history on the videos. These cameras should definitely come with these SD cards. There is no subscription, set up was easy, and I have great WI-FI through direct TV. Cameras do not buffer, they come on pretty quickly when I access the app. At night, when I pull in the driveway, the light on the camera comes on, which I like. It is super sensitive and picks up any motion. People walking, dogs running, trucks or cars coming down the street. Oh and I also think that there should be a little booklet with the icon definitions that explain what certain icons means. I emailed them asking them and they were knowledgeable about the icons.

There were things in the user interface that I didn\u2019t like and the company responded to the feedback within one update. Everything I mentioned was added! I\u2019ve never met a company that actually implemented individual feedback. Usually the company collects a bunch of feedback and if enough people ask for the same thing, then they implement it eventually.  Aosu cameras have great quality. They have something other UI don\u2019t have, which is an indication of events on the playback track itself. You can jump to an event which is coloured in blue, or you can start recording before the event (but if you want to record the event with before and after make sure you start recording slightly before the event in blue otherwise it will record the event and say \u201cfile saved\u201d). The audio is great, however I don\u2019t ever use the family call button. I use the cameras on 5 GHz internet but the good thing is you can use both! Other cameras only use 2.4. The main reason I selected Aosu is the value = pan and tilt + 2K quality. Very good price for the features you get and the user interface is quite pleasant.

The only slightly negative thing is that it is a lot smaller than I anticipated it to be, but it is good for small hands.

Read more", "I bought this camera to record my drum practice sessions and I needed to buy at a budget price. This camera met my needs to perform this function.  I record with regular indoor lighting and this camera was able to record clear video at all the available resolutions, although I typically record at 1080p 30 fps to get best results without using a ton of memory space.  The menu is easy to navigate and even though the manual does not go much into depth for describing all the menu functions, I was able to search the web and watch YouTube videos to get a better understanding of the various menu functions. For the most part, I have been using the default menu settings except for Recording Resolution, which I set for 1080P 30fps and metering mode, which I set to Matrix Metering.  The internal microphone is adequate for recording voice audio from within a few feet from the camera, but it was not what I wanted for recording music. I initially had an issue with using external microphones. I contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in responding to my inquiries and helping me resolve my issue with using external microphones. I wanted to record from two speakers that were connected to my E-Drum Kit and connecting the microphones direct to the camera using a stereo Y splitter would not work, also I could not get regular external camera microphones to work either. However, the seller gave me the information I needed to get the right equipment to record the way I wanted to record.  The camera records audio in Mono (one channel) using a 3.5mm (1/8\u201d) TRS mic jack. The camera\u2019s mic input also needed to come from a powered mic source and the mic output must be in Mono. There are many battery powered mics to be found on Amazon. I decided to get a Comica CVM-AX1 mic mixer that can take a Stereo input from two mics and output to the camera in Mono. For my shotgun mic I got a Comica V30 PRO. Both of these mic solutions work great with this camera and each of these two items cost less than $50 each.  I also upgraded the memory card to a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card for around $15  All-in-all, even with these additional items I purchased, it cost a lot less than the $500~$600 price of a brand name camera.

She and her brother (5) have been having a ball for nearly a month now playing with all the features and frames and games on this camera, and still haven't exhausted all its possibilities yet! The pictures are good quality, there are so many extras bundled in the box, and you get a lot of bang for your buck insofar as the number of pictures per refill (Protip: buy a bundle of paper rolls when you buy this camera, they will still find a way to use them up faster than you can have new ones shipped!)

I\u2019d recommend playing around with the settings because you can see the difference in the pictures I tested just by changing printing density & printing type! I recommend using DOT print. This camera would even be great for adults. I have a Polaroid camera and haven\u2019t used it more than a few times because the cost of film. This comes with so much extra rolls of film! Also what I love about this is that it saves the pictures so you can make multiple copies! So if you don\u2019t like the quality of the photo you can always mess with the settings and print it again! Only thing I would change is for there to be an option for printing in color!", "I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter for Christmas along with an extra supply of thermal printing paper. It was easy to set up and she was able to grasp how to use it very quickly. Mom and dad won't have to worry about buying expensive film for this instant print camera.

But there are some things that could be improved:  1. The need for a subscription after some time was not clearly described in the listing. The camera still works and records to the SD memory, but after a few weeks, it won't allow you to remotely playback recorded video accessed through notifications.  2. Motion detection could be refined, as I sometimes receive a notification even when turning on a light. I'm unsure if this is intended, but it's unsettling to get a motion detection notification when simply turning on room lights.  3. Night vision is quite good, but it would be nice to have an option to adjust its intensity, similar to how you adjust the settings when taking a picture with your phone. Initially placed in front of a window, when night came, the night vision activated the IR LEDs, revealing nothing more than its reflection. The good thing is that you can change the night vision mode to normal, and it still adjusts the ISO to try and capture what it can in low-light conditions.

Not very detail over 4 mts (3.3 ft) but I guess this is not the purpose of these cameras.  Setting up the camera are kinda problematic due to some steps that aren't very clear (maybe it was my smartphone that is 3 years old) but to pair the camera to your WiFi network the app creates a secondary WiFi signal and my phone did not change automatically to the latter network. I did not realize of this step (my mistake) and wasted almost an hour trying to figure out why the camera could not connect to my WiFi. Besides that problem and some minor privacy settings that are weird, the camera works just fine. They record and notifies quite fast of any movement or activity in their surroundings.  Sound quality is not something to praise but is functional, as well as the mic (yes, one can have a conversation with a person in the other end). Function wise, there are nice settings like turning off the red dot, framing specific parts of the room to quickly turn the camera to frame that specific place, automatic detection, turn on/off the alarm, face detection and so on. Feature-wise is very complete.  One downside might be the storage. If you don't buy the cloud service or do not have an SD, the camera will not record any activity by itself. It will still notifies you about any movement but It will be not possible to see what had happened. So at least get a 64GB SD card if you are not interested in cloud storage.  Overall, the camera is a solid choice (in any light conditions) and app is really feature pack to customize it to your liking.

Marketing it as such is dangerous and unethical.  Pros: - Nightvision is excellent - Video quality is good  Cons: - The app constantly freezes while you are observing your baby. You will think you are keeping an eye on your baby, but you'd be wrong. - The app constantly needs to be force closed and reopened to establish a connection to the camera - The camera constantly disconnects from wifi (not an issue with any other device in our home) - The camera needs to be occasionally reset and repaired - You can only use one login to view the feed. That means if you want your babysitter or whomever to be able to use the app, you have to share your login with them. - The app constantly displays a \"Cam update available\" that does nothing. - Very expensive for a wifi camera - Notifications only work when the app is already open, rendering it useless - Does not come with a mount that you can use on a crib, you'll have to buy this separately.  We feel like suckers for buying this product. My husband attempted to review on amazon and was not allowed because he was not a verified purchaser. I wonder how many more people who put this on their registry that are unhappy with this are unable to leave a review. Gigantic waste of money, on an unreliable piece of junk. Our Gen 1 google nest cam that was 1/2 of the price 8 years ago, works much better, is reliable, and has all the functionality missing from the Owlet. You also get video history with the nest and you don\u2019t with the Owlet. Do not buy this, you will regret it.

Before purchasing this camera I bought the Canon 5D Mark IV $2900 + lens Canon EF 50mm f/1.2 $1500 (even though it\u2019s older\u2026 wanted to use it because I heard it was awesome). Had it for 3 days & found it to be perfect for my except the focusing. I was having issues with focusing which is not great for me since I\u2019m a YouTube content creator. Maybe it was too much camera for me. Just my honest opinion.  Next I purchased the Sony a7 IV $2895 now this one I was very excited because it came with a lens & it was lightweight. If used correctly, it is a WONDERFUL camera. Use it for small video clips & pictures. NOT for long form content because it will overheat! After 10 mins just being on \u201cBOOM\u201d overheated & believe me I was in a 65\u00b0 studio room. I love my office to be cold coming from San Francisco moving to Phoenix\u2026 yeah I need it cold. Not used to the heat. So I noticed overheating issues. Took it outside to take some pictures of my husband doing a golf tournament & once again it overheated after a three minute video clip but I\u2019m sure it was also because I was under an umbrella outdoors where the heat was 110\u00b0 so that didn\u2019t make it any easier for the camera. Shortform recording excellent, longform nope! Returned it after 2 days. If you live in AZ, forget it. Not a smart purchase.  Pretty bummed but decided to order this camera, Lumix S5IIX $2900 (with the lens kit) it was back ordered but was it worth it? YES!!! It\u2019s crystal clear, the pictures are amazing. Wow! The camera is gorgeous & not as heavy as the Canon. Panasonic has created a beast, seriously. Didn\u2019t have to purchase a starter lens which made my purchase feel great & on top of that the auto focus works like magick! The camera is easy to work with, especially from someone who isn\u2019t tech savvy at all. The camera isn\u2019t as heavy as the Canon but it\u2019s heavier than the Sony of course. But here\u2019s my favorite part. Took it to my sons jiu jitsu tournament in 104\u00b0 weather, it didn\u2019t overheat! It has a built in fan, omgggg. Next the focus was phenomenal\u2026 I didn\u2019t struggle at all. The stabilization on this camera is smooth as butter to use. I\u2019m telling you from someone who doesn\u2019t know anything about cameras, I\u2019m hooked. I\u2019m so obsessed with my camera that I was showcasing it lol. People were asking me what camera did I have at the tournament, because they loved the look. I converted two Canon photographers over to the Panasonic side. No joke, this is a steal. Buy it! It will be worth every penny.  Xya Soul \ud83d\udc95 Read more", "Easily the best camera under $5,000. Bomb video features, great photo capability, and to top it off, great price!", "Great buy on an excellent camera with lens", "Llego en perfecto estado y mucho antes de lo pensado. Excelente y justo lo que esperaba, una camara 100% recomendable", "When you press the shutter halfway to get a focus, this camera behaves like no camera I've ever seen. When pressed halfway, the image itself changes. The image gets somewhat brighter or darker, depending on your \"real\" image settings\" and this changes the depth of field as well. When you complete the picture, the result is the original look. So, the half pressed shutter changes the look of the composition, but those changes are not reflected on the final image. I think a lot of photographers use the half pressed moment to focus and for \"last looks\", but this is impossible with this camera. To get last looks, you'd have to half press to get focus and then let go to see what the final image will look like with focus applied and then press the button again.  In the troubleshooting part of the manual this is addressed and says \"This is not a malfunction.\"  Why would I want to see a version of the picture that is NOT being taken?", "I feel like I'll have a camera for long on my Panasonic LUMIX S5IIX.", "Edited: I got to test the camera today, and I noticed that it was an open box when i received, but i figured, eh, looks brand new, what can be the issue. I Wanted to test the video and photo, the autofocus is horrible, I switched to vlog, and these thick lines started going from bottom of monitor to the top of the monitor, and that's how the video is recorded, with these lines! Seems like i got a broken camera....2,600$ for a broken camera. I still want this camera (not this one), i've seen the videos online and read the specs and it's awesome, but being that this was an open box, it seems there was something wrong with it. Returning it.", "When you are composing your shot and you see a nice shallow depth of field with a blurred background, you then take that shot and look at the resulting picture and the depth of field is completely different with the background being in sharp focus. I don't know why anyone would want to see an image that isn't the image that will be captured. I've been told to turn Constant Preview on. I have done that and I have tried all 3 of the setting and they all have the same results. What you see on the screen and through the viewfinder is not what your final image will look like. So, to compose properly with this camera, you have to take a picture first, try and determine what settings would cause that picture to change in a way that will result in the picture you want, and just keep testing until you get the result. It's akin to using a film camera. Much faster obviously. But you still have to take the picture and hope for the best. It's only after the picture is developed that you know for sure what you've got. This is a big failure by Lumix.", "Great camera for shooting videos.
